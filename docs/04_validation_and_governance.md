# Validation and Governance

## Human Oversight

All extracted texts are manually reviewed before being used
in any AI-assisted analysis.

No automated decision-making is performed.

## Traceability

Each processed text file can be traced back to:
- A specific authoritative source
- An unmodified original PDF

## Limitations

- Extracted text may contain formatting artefacts
- Legal interpretation remains the responsibility of a human reviewer

These limitations are explicitly acknowledged to avoid
overreliance on automated systems.
