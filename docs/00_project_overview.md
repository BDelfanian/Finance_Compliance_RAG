# Project Overview

## Purpose

This project explores the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and multi-agent AI workflows to support compliance risk assessment
over unstructured financial regulatory documents.

The prototype is designed as a public-data analogue of internal
compliance review tools used in regulated financial institutions.

## Scope (MVP)

Included:
- Regulatory documents from CSSF and EU authorities
- Text extraction and preparation for retrieval
- Explainable, retrieval-grounded analysis

Excluded (at this stage):
- Automated decision-making
- Proprietary or confidential data
- Model fine-tuning

## Guiding Principles

- Traceability of sources
- Explainability over performance
- Human-in-the-loop oversight
- Reproducibility
