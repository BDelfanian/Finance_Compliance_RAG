# Decision Log

## Choice of pdfplumber
Selected for reliable extraction of legal PDFs and preservation
of document structure.

## No OCR
Documents are text-based; OCR would introduce noise and errors.

## Use of requirements.txt
Chosen for simplicity, transparency, and reproducibility.

## Limited document set
Scope intentionally restricted to ensure quality and traceability
during early prototyping.
