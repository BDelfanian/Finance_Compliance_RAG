  "answer": "Below is a concise, source\u2011based summary of the ICT outsourcing and third\u2011party risk management obligations for EU financial institutions under the CSSF guidance, DORA and the EBA guidelines. All points cite only the provided source chunks.\n\n1) Governance, roles and ICT risk\u2011management framework\n- Financial institutions must identify, assess, measure, monitor and report ICT and security risks, embed ICT/security risk management into overall risk processes, and review/approve the framework at least annually. Responsibility for oversight must be assigned to a control function independent from ICT operations; internal audit must be able to provide independent assurance [CSSF 3.3.1 / 10\u201114].  \n- For smaller/simplified entities DORA requires a documented, continuously monitored ICT risk framework, including monitoring, continuity, testing and reporting on reviews to supervisors [DORA Article 16 / 1\u20112].\n\n2) Risk assessment, due diligence and classification before and during outsourcing\n- Institutions must perform risk\u2011based analysis and classify functions, data and systems by sensitivity; assess operational, legal, ICT, compliance, reputational risks and oversight limitations (including country/legal/insolvency issues); and consider substitutability and reintegration ability before outsourcing and on an ongoing basis [EBA 68 / a\u2011d, h\u2011i; EBA 31 / a\u2011j].  \n- EBA requires adequate due diligence and internal governance arrangements for outsourcing critical/important functions [EBA 5 / general; EBA 68 / a\u2011f].\n\n3) Contractual and service\u2011level requirements\n- Contracts must clearly allocate rights/obligations in writing and include SLAs; describe functions and permitted subcontracting; specify data processing and storage locations and notification of location changes; and include provisions on availability, integrity, confidentiality, access/recovery/return of data (including on provider insolvency) [DORA Article 30 / 1\u20112(a)\u2011(d)].  \n- Contracts must require provider assistance during ICT incidents, cooperation with competent/resolution authorities, termination rights and notice periods, and participation in entity security awareness/training [DORA Article 30 / 2(f)\u2011(h), 2(i)].  \n- For services supporting critical/important functions, contracts must add precise quantitative/qualitative SLAs, provider reporting/notice obligations, requirements to implement/test contingency plans and security measures, TLPT participation, ongoing monitoring and extensive audit/inspection/exit rights including mandatory transition periods [DORA Article 30 / 3(a)\u2011(f)].  \n- CSSF similarly requires outsourcing contracts/SLA to include proportionate information\u2011security objectives, data life\u2011cycle, encryption/network\u2011security/location of data centres and operational/security incident handling including escalation and reporting; and institutions must monitor provider compliance with those security objectives and SLAs [CSSF 3.2.3 / 8(a)\u2011(b), 9].\n\n4) Monitoring, audit rights and assurance\n- Institutions must retain the right and ability to monitor and obtain assurance over provider compliance with security objectives and SLAs; DORA grants financial entities (and competent authorities) rights of on\u2011site inspection/audit, copying documentation, and to require cooperation during inspections; alternatives for microenterprises are allowed with conditions [CSSF 3.2.3 / 9; DORA Article 30 / 3(e)(i)\u2011(iv)].  \n- EBA requires that outsourcing risks are identified, managed and mitigated and that an appropriate flow of relevant information with service providers is maintained [EBA 40 / c\u2011e].\n\n5) Business continuity, contingency testing and exit/substitutability\n- Institutions must define and implement mitigation measures to reduce ICT/security risks to acceptable levels and consider time to implement changes and interim measures [CSSF 3.3.4 / 22\u201123].  \n- Contracts for critical/important functions must require tested contingency plans and exit/transition strategies (including mandatory transition periods) enabling migration or reintegration to avoid disruption [DORA Article 30 / 3(c), 3(f); EBA 40 / f].  \n- EBA requires that, for outsourced critical/important functions, institutions can within an appropriate timeframe transfer to alternative providers, reintegrate the function, or discontinue dependent business lines [EBA 40 / f(i)\u2011(iii)].\n\n6) ICT operations, security controls and project management\n- Institutions must implement operational security controls (vulnerability identification and patching, secure configurations, segmentation, DLP and encryption in transit/at rest, endpoint protection, integrity verification) and ensure changes are managed via change management processes [CSSF 3.4.4 / 36\u201137].  \n- ICT project governance, risk assessment and independent approval of security requirements are required; project risks and progress must be reported to the management body [CSSF 3.6.1 / 61\u201166].\n\n7) Concentration risk, critical provider designation and oversight (DORA)\n- Financial entities must assess ICT concentration/substitutability risk when contracting providers and weigh alternatives to avoid dependencies on non\u2011substitutable providers or multiple arrangements with the same provider [DORA Article 29 / 1].  \n- DORA establishes an EU oversight framework to designate \u201ccritical ICT third\u2011party service providers\u201d based on systemic impact, reliance, substitutability and market concentration; designated providers are subject to Lead Overseer oversight and publication of a Union list [DORA Article 31 / 1\u20113, 9].  \n- The Oversight Forum/Joint Committee coordinate cross\u2011sector oversight, benchmarks and annual assessments to address ICT third\u2011party risk at Union level [DORA Article 32 / 1\u20113].\n\n8) Third\u2011country outsourcing, supervisory cooperation and data protection\n- Where outsourcing to a third\u2011country provider occurs, institutions must consider compliance with Union data protection rules, enforceability of law in that third country, and insolvency/recovery constraints; long/complex subcontracting chains must be assessed for monitoring and supervisory impact [DORA Article 29 / 2; EBA 68 / b\u2011d].  \n- EBA requires that outsourcing to a third\u2011country service provider that performs functions requiring authorisation/registration only occurs if the provider is supervised in that third country and there is an appropriate cooperation agreement enabling competent authorities to obtain information/access for supervisory purposes [EBA 63 / a\u2011c].  \n- EBA and DORA require attention to data protection/GDPR where personal data are processed by providers in the EU or third countries [EBA 40 / g; DORA Article 29 / 2 (data protection compliance referenced)].\n\n9) Ongoing reporting, testing and improvements\n- Institutions must monitor effectiveness of controls and the number of reported incidents, report ICT/security risks to the management body, and update the ICT/security risk framework after major changes or incidents; frameworks should be documented and continuously improved based on lessons learned [CSSF 3.3.1 / 13\u201114; CSSF 3.3.4 / 22\u201123].  \n- DORA requires entities to assess and report preliminary ICT concentration risk (and to weigh benefits/costs of alternatives) as part of their identification and assessment obligations [DORA Article 29 / 1\u20112].  \n- DORA also foresees regulatory technical standards and further specifications to be developed by the ESAs on elements of contracts and ICT risk management (timelines noted in DORA) [DORA Article 30 / 5; DORA Article 16 / 3].\n\nIf you want, I can produce a checklist mapping these obligations to specific contract clauses, governance tasks and monitoring actions with the exact citation for each checklist item.",
