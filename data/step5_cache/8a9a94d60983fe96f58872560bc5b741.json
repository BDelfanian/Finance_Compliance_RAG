  "query": "What are the incident notification procedures for significant cyber threats affecting EU banks according to CSSF, DORA, and EBA?\n",
  "answer": "Summary of incident-notification procedures based on the provided sources\n\nCSSF (circular \u2014 ICT incident and problem management)\n- Banks must establish an incident and problem management process to monitor and log operational and security ICT incidents, set criteria/thresholds and early\u2011warning indicators, and ensure timely continuation/resumption of critical business functions [CSSF 3.5.1 / para 59].  \n- The process must define procedures to identify, track, log, categorise and classify incidents, assign roles/responsibilities (including for cyber-attacks), and perform root\u2011cause problem management and lessons\u2011learned [CSSF 3.5.1 / para 60 a\u2013c].  \n- Internal communication plans must include incident notification and escalation so that incidents with potentially high adverse impact on critical ICT systems/services are reported to relevant senior management and ICT senior management; the management body must be informed ad hoc for significant incidents (impact, response, additional controls) [CSSF 3.5.1 / para 60 d(i\u2013ii)].  \n- External communication plans must cover collaboration with stakeholders and timely information to external parties (e.g. customers, other market participants, the supervisory authority) as appropriate and in line with applicable regulation [CSSF 3.5.1 / para 60 f(i\u2013ii)].\n\nDORA (Regulation on digital operational resilience)\n- Classification: financial entities must classify ICT incidents using set criteria (affected clients/transactions, duration/downtime, geographic spread, data losses, service criticality, economic impact) and classify cyber threats as \u201csignificant\u201d based on criticality, targeted clients/counterparts and geographic spread [DORA Article 18 / paras 1\u20132].  \n- Reporting of major ICT-related incidents: financial entities must report major ICT-related incidents to the relevant competent authority using the required templates after collecting and analysing relevant information; templates are those referred to in Article 20 (alternative means allowed if technical impossibility) [DORA Article 19 / para 1].  \n- Voluntary notification of significant cyber threats: financial entities may voluntarily notify the relevant competent authority of significant cyber threats they deem relevant to the financial system, service users or clients; competent authorities may pass such information to other authorities (and certain entities must immediately transmit to the ECB) [DORA Article 19 / para 2].  \n- Client notification: where a major ICT-related incident impacts clients\u2019 financial interests, entities must inform clients without undue delay of the incident and mitigation measures; for significant cyber threats, entities should, where applicable, inform potentially affected clients of appropriate protection measures [DORA Article 19 / para 3].  \n- Reporting timeline and content: entities must submit (within Article 20 time limits) an initial notification, intermediate reports when status/handling changes (and updates on relevant status changes or upon authority request), and a final report once root\u2011cause analysis is completed and actual impact figures are available [DORA Article 19 / para 4].  \n- Outsourcing: reporting obligations may be outsourced but the financial entity remains fully responsible [DORA Article 19 / para 5].  \n- Competent\u2011authority onward transmission and coordination: upon receipt of reports, competent authorities shall timely provide incident details to EBA/ESMA/EIOPA, ECB (as applicable), other competent authorities/CSIRTs, resolution authorities/SRB and other relevant public authorities; EBA/ESMA/EIOPA and the ECB (in consultation with ENISA and the competent authority) will assess cross\u2011border relevance and notify other Member State competent authorities as needed [DORA Article 19 / para 6\u20137].  \n- Supervisory feedback: competent authorities shall acknowledge receipt of reports and may provide timely, relevant and proportionate feedback or high\u2011level guidance (including anonymised intelligence); financial entities remain fully responsible for handling incidents [DORA Article 22 / para 1].  \n- Information sharing: financial entities may exchange cyber threat information/intelligence within trusted communities under rules protecting sensitivity and data protection; entities must notify competent authorities of their participation in such information\u2011sharing arrangements upon validation (or of cessation) [DORA Article 45 / paras 1\u20133].\n\nEBA\n- Information not available in retrieved sources.",
