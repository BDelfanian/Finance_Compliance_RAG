set clear roles and responsibilities for ICT functions, information security risk management and business continuity (management body and its committees) [CSSF 3.2.1 / para 2].  \n- Ensure adequate quantity, skills and training of staff and an appropriate budget to support ICT operations, ICT/security risk management and ICT strategy implementation; ensure annual (or more frequent) training on ICT and security risks for staff and key function holders [CSSF 3.2.1 / para 3].  \n- Hold overall accountability for setting, approving and overseeing implementation of the institution\u2019s ICT strategy and for establishing an effective ICT/security risk management framework [CSSF 3.2.1 / para 4].  \n- Require that ICT functions have controls/processes to identify, assess, measure, monitor, manage and report ICT/security risks and ensure compliance with internal/external requirements; integrate the ICT/security risk management framework into overall risk management [CSSF 3.3.1 / paras 10, 12].  \n- Assign responsibility for managing/overseeing ICT and security risks to a control function, ensure its independence from ICT operations and direct accountability to the management body; ensure internal audit can independently review ICT/security activities (internal audit must be independent from that control function) [CSSF 3.3.1 / para 11].  \n- Ensure the ICT/security risk management framework (including risk appetite, risk identification, mitigation controls, monitoring, incident reporting to the management body and annual review) is documented, approved and reviewed at least annually [CSSF 3.3.1 / paras 13\u201314].  \n- Require programme/project governance for ICT projects, including defined roles/responsibilities, risk assessment, project plans and change management; ensure information security requirements are analysed/approved by a function independent from development; receive regular (and ad hoc as appropriate) reporting on ICT project establishment, progress and risks [CSSF 3.6.1 / paras 61\u201366].\n\nDORA (Article 5, Article 6, Article 11, Article 17)\n- Put in place an internal governance and control framework ensuring effective and prudent management of ICT risk and high digital operational resilience; the management body must define, approve, oversee and be responsible for implementation of all arrangements related to the ICT risk management framework [DORA Article 5 / paras 1\u20132].  \n- Bear ultimate responsibility for ICT risk; adopt policies to ensure availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of data; set clear roles/responsibilities for ICT-related functions and governance to ensure timely communication/cooperation among them [DORA Article 5 / para 2 (a)\u2013(c)].  \n- Set and approve the digital operational resilience strategy, including determination of ICT risk tolerance/risk appetite [DORA Article 5 / para 2 (d); DORA Article 6 / para 8(b)].  \n- Approve, oversee and periodically review ICT business continuity policy and ICT response and recovery plans, internal audit plans/audits for ICT, and material modifications to them; allocate and periodically review budget for digital operational resilience including training and ICT skills [DORA Article 5 / para 2 (e)\u2013(g)].  \n- Approve and periodically review policy on use of ICT services provided by third\u2011party ICT service providers; ensure reporting channels at corporate level to be informed on third\u2011party arrangements, material changes, impact analyses and at least major ICT-related incidents and their impacts and remediation [DORA Article 5 / para 2 (h)\u2013(i)].  \n- Ensure members of the management body maintain up\u2011to\u2011date knowledge/skills on ICT risk and follow regular, commensurate training [DORA Article 5 / para 4].  \n- Require a sound, documented ICT risk management framework as part of overall risk management, with protection for information/ICT assets, and with minimisation of ICT risk through appropriate strategies, policies, procedures and tools [DORA Article 6 / paras 1\u20133].  \n- Assign responsibility for managing/overseeing ICT risk to a control function, ensure its appropriate level of independence and segregation among ICT risk management, control and internal audit functions (three lines of defence or equivalent) [DORA Article 6 / para 4].  \n- Ensure the ICT risk management framework is documented, reviewed at least annually (or periodically for microenterprises), improved from lessons learned and subject to internal audit; implement follow\u2011up and remediation of critical ICT audit findings [DORA Article 6 / paras 5\u20137].  \n- Ensure implementation of a digital operational resilience strategy describing how the ICT risk management framework supports business strategy, establishes ICT risk tolerance, sets information security objectives/KPIs, detection/prevention mechanisms and testing, and a communication strategy for incidents [DORA Article 6 / para 8].  \n- Approve and oversee ICT business continuity and response/recovery arrangements (including testing, BIA and regular testing of plans and crisis communication); ensure ICT response and recovery plans are audited and that major incidents and impacts are reported to senior management and the management body [DORA Article 11 / paras 1\u20136; DORA Article 11 / paras 3\u20136; DORA Article 17 / para 3(e)].\n\nEBA (EBA 36)\n- The management body is fully responsible and accountable for: ensuring ongoing compliance with authorisation/conditions; the internal organisation of the institution; identification, assessment and management of conflicts of interest; setting strategies and policies (including risk appetite and risk management framework); overseeing day\u2011to\u2011day management (including management of risks associated with outsourcing); and fulfilling its supervisory/oversight role over management decision\u2011making [EBA 36 / points a\u2013f].\n\nIf you want a one\u2011page checklist or a mapping table (CSSF vs DORA vs EBA) of these duties, tell me and I will produce it.",
