  "query": "Explain the duties of the management body regarding ICT governance and internal controls under CSSF, DORA, and EBA guidelines.\n",
  "answer": "Summary of duties (strictly from the provided sources)\n\nCSSF (governance and internal controls)\n- Ensure an adequate internal governance and internal control framework for ICT and security risks; set clear roles and responsibilities for ICT functions, information\u2011security risk management and business continuity (including roles of the management body and its committees) [CSSF 3.2.1 / para 2].  \n- Ensure staff numbers, skills and budget are adequate to support ICT operations and ICT/security risk management; ensure staff (including key function holders) receive appropriate ICT/security training at least annually or more often if needed [CSSF 3.2.1 / para 3].  \n- Accept overall accountability for setting, approving and overseeing the implementation of the institution\u2019s ICT strategy and for establishing an effective ICT/security risk management framework [CSSF 3.2.1 / para 4].  \n- Require that a control function is assigned responsibility for managing and overseeing ICT and security risks, ensure that control function\u2019s independence and segregation from ICT operations, and that it reports directly to the management body (the control function must not also be the internal audit) [CSSF 3.3.1 / para 11].  \n- Ensure internal audit can independently review and provide objective assurance on ICT and security activities in a risk\u2011based manner [CSSF 3.3.1 / para 11].  \n- Define and assign key ICT/security roles, responsibilities and reporting lines and integrate the ICT/security risk management framework into overall risk management [CSSF 3.3.1 / para 12].  \n- Approve and review (at least annually) a documented ICT and security risk management framework that includes setting ICT risk appetite, identifying/assessing risks, defining mitigation controls, monitoring effectiveness and reporting to the management body, and assessing risks after major changes or incidents [CSSF 3.3.1 / paras 13\u201314].  \n- Oversee ICT project governance: ensure programmes/processes define roles, responsibilities and accountabilities; ensure project risks (including interdependencies) are monitored; and receive regular (or ad\u2011hoc) reporting on ICT project establishment, progress and associated risks [CSSF 3.6.1 / paras 61\u201363, 66].\n\nDORA (Regulation on digital operational resilience)\n- The management body must define, approve, oversee and be responsible for implementing all arrangements related to the ICT risk management framework; it bears ultimate responsibility for ICT risk [DORA Article 5 / para 2; Article 5 / para 2(a)].  \n- Put in place policies to maintain high standards of availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of data; set clear roles/responsibilities for all ICT\u2011related functions and governance arrangements to ensure effective communication and coordination among them [DORA Article 5 / para 2(b)\u2013(c)].  \n- Set and approve the digital operational resilience strategy, including determining the entity\u2019s ICT risk tolerance level [DORA Article 5 / para 2(d); Article 6 / para 8(b)].  \n- Approve, oversee and periodically review the ICT business continuity policy and ICT response and recovery plans; approve and periodically review ICT internal audit plans and material changes to them [DORA Article 5 / para 2(e)\u2013(f)].  \n- Allocate and periodically review an appropriate budget to meet digital operational resilience needs (including ICT security awareness programmes and staff ICT skills/training) [DORA Article 5 / para 2(g)].  \n- Approve and periodically review policy on the use of ICT services provided by third\u2011party ICT service providers and put in place corporate reporting channels to be informed about third\u2011party arrangements, material changes, their impact and major ICT\u2011related incidents [DORA Article 5 / para 2(h)\u2013(i)].  \n- Ensure members of the management body keep up to date with sufficient ICT risk knowledge and skills, including by following regular specific training commensurate to the ICT risk [DORA Article 5 / para 4].  \n- Ensure the entity has a sound, documented ICT risk management framework as part of overall risk management; assign responsibility for ICT risk to a control function with appropriate independence; require the framework to be documented, reviewed at least annually (and after major incidents) and subject to internal audit in line with the audit plan; and ensure establishment of a digital operational resilience strategy with defined information security objectives, KPIs and risk tolerance [DORA Article 6 / paras 1,4\u20136,8].\n\nEBA (management body responsibilities relevant to governance and controls)\n- The management body is fully responsible and accountable for: ongoing compliance with authorisation conditions; the institution\u2019s internal organisation; identification, assessment and management of conflicts of interest; setting strategies and policies (including business model, risk appetite and risk management framework); overseeing day\u2011to\u2011day management (including risks from outsourcing); and exercising oversight of management decision\u2011making [EBA 36 / a\u2013f].\n\nIf you would like, I can produce a concise checklist mapping these duties into actions a management body should take (e.g., approve documented framework, ensure training, appoint independent control function, set reporting channels), but only if you want that derived checklist (it will be based strictly on the cited paragraphs).",
