  "query": "Which templates and deadlines must EU financial entities follow when reporting ICT incidents to competent authorities under CSSF, DORA, and EBA?\n",
  "answer": "Summary from the retrieved sources:\n\n- DORA (mandatory templates, reports and timing mechanism)\n  - Financial entities must produce the initial notification and subsequent reports using the templates referred to in Article 20 (or notify by alternative means if a technical impossibility prevents use of the template) [DORA Article 19 / para 1].\n  - Required reports to the competent authority are: an initial notification; an intermediate report after the initial notification whenever the incident status or handling changes (and updates whenever relevant status updates are available or on request); and a final report when the root\u2011cause analysis is completed and actual impact figures are available [DORA Article 19 / para 4].\n  - The time limits for the initial notification and for each report are to be determined pursuant to Article 20 (i.e. set in the regulatory technical standards) and the ESAs (through the Joint Committee), in consultation with ENISA and the ECB, are tasked with developing the common draft RTS/ITS to establish report content, templates and the time limits; those draft standards were to be submitted to the Commission by 17 July 2024 [DORA Article 19 / para 4; DORA Article 20 / para 1(a)(ii) & (b); DORA Article 20 / submission deadline].\n\n- CSSF (national circular excerpt)\n  - The CSSF circular requires financial institutions to establish incident and problem management processes and to have external communication plans that provide timely information to external parties including the supervisory authority where appropriate [CSSF 3.5.1 / para 59; CSSF 3.5.1 / para 60.d.i-ii; CSSF 3.5.1 / para 60.f].\n  - The CSSF chunk provided does not specify any standard templates or concrete reporting deadlines for submission of ICT incident reports to competent authorities in the retrieved text. Information not available in retrieved sources.\n\n- EBA\n  - The retrieved DORA text refers to EBA as a recipient of incident information from competent authorities for assessment and cross\u2011border notification purposes [DORA Article 19 / para 6-7].\n  - The retrieved sources do not provide any EBA\u2011specific reporting templates or concrete deadlines to be followed by financial entities. Information not available in retrieved sources.\n\nIf you want, I can extract and list the exact DORA report elements and the ESA drafting obligations cited above; however, specific template forms and the concrete time limits are not present in the provided source chunks.",
