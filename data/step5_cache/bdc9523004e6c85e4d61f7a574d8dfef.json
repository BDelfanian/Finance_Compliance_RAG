  "query": "Explain reporting obligations for EU financial entities under CSSF, DORA, and EBA.",
  "answer": "Short answer\n- DORA sets specific incident-reporting duties for financial entities (major ICT\u2011related incidents; voluntary notifications of significant cyber threats), the required reports and timing, client notification duties, outsourcing rules and onward sharing by competent authorities; the ESAs (including EBA) must produce harmonised templates and timing rules [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 1\u20117; DORA Article 20 / Article 20 / 1(a)\u2011(b)].\n- EBA\u2019s role under DORA: receive incident details from competent authorities, participate (with ESMA/EIOPA and the ECB, and in consultation with ENISA) in assessing cross\u2011border relevance and notifying other competent authorities, and participate via the ESAs in developing the common reporting standards/templates [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 6\u20117; DORA Article 20 / Article 20 / 1].\n- CSSF: Information not available in retrieved sources.\n\nKey DORA reporting obligations (with sources)\n- What must be reported: financial entities must report major ICT\u2011related incidents to the relevant competent authority and may voluntarily notify significant cyber threats to that authority [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 1; 2].\n- Single point of contact: if a financial entity is supervised by more than one national competent authority, Member States shall designate a single competent authority to receive the report [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 1].\n- Templates and content: the initial notification and subsequent reports must be produced after collecting and analysing relevant information using the templates referred to in Article 20; they must include all information necessary for the competent authority to determine significance and cross\u2011border impact. If technical impossibility prevents using the template, alternative means may be used [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 1].\n- Reports required/timing: financial entities must submit (i) an initial notification, (ii) an intermediate report whenever status/handling changes (and updated notifications on relevant status updates or on request), and (iii) a final report when root cause analysis is complete and actual impact figures are available. Time limits for these submissions are to be laid down in accordance with Article 20 (see Article 20 for harmonisation of time limits) [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 4; DORA Article 20 / Article 20 / 1(a)(ii)].\n- Client notification: where a major ICT\u2011related incident impacts clients\u2019 financial interests, entities must inform affected clients without undue delay about the incident and mitigation measures; for significant cyber threats, entities should inform potentially affected clients of appropriate protection measures, where applicable [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 3].\n- Outsourcing: reporting obligations may be outsourced to a third\u2011party service provider under applicable law, but the financial entity remains fully responsible for meeting the incident reporting requirements [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 5].\n- Competent authority onward sharing: upon receipt of notifications/reports, the competent authority must timely provide incident details to EBA, ESMA or EIOPA; the ECB (for certain entities); competent authorities/single points of contact/CSIRTs; resolution authorities and the SRB where relevant; and other relevant public authorities under national law [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 6].\n- Cross\u2011border assessment and notification: after receipt, EBA/ESMA/EIOPA and the ECB, in consultation with ENISA and cooperating with the relevant competent authority, shall assess whether an incident is relevant for other Member States and notify those competent authorities as appropriate to protect financial stability; the ECB notifies the ESCB on payment\u2011system issues [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 7].\n\nEBA / ESAs role in harmonisation (with sources)\n- The ESAs (which include EBA), through the Joint Committee and in consultation with ENISA and the ECB, must develop:\n  - regulatory technical standards to: (i) set report content reflecting Article 18(1) criteria and elements to assess relevance for other Member States and payment\u2011related incidents, (ii) determine time limits for initial notification and each report, and (iii) establish content for significant cyber threat notifications; and\n  - implementing technical standards to set standard forms, templates and procedures for reporting and notification [DORA Article 20 / Article 20 / 1(a)(i)\u2011(iii); 1(b)].\n- The ESAs must submit those draft standards to the Commission by 17 July 2024; the Commission has powers to adopt them [DORA Article 20 / Article 20 / 2\u20113].\n\nMissing information\n- Specific CSSF reporting obligations or any Luxembourg\u2011specific implementation details are not present in the retrieved sources.
