  "query": "Which templates and deadlines must EU financial entities follow when reporting ICT incidents to competent authorities under CSSF, DORA, and EBA?",
  "answer": "Summary from the retrieved sources\n\n- Which reports must be submitted: DORA requires an initial notification, intermediate report(s) (when status/handling changes or upon competent\u2011authority request) and a final report (after root\u2011cause analysis and when actual impact figures are available) [DORA Article 19 / 4].\n\n- Which templates to use: DORA requires financial entities to produce the initial notification and reports using the templates that are to be developed under Article 20 (common standard forms/templates) \u2014 and to submit by those templates (or, if a technical impossibility prevents use of the template, notify by alternative means) [DORA Article 19 / 1]; [DORA Article 19 / 1 (technical impossibility)].\n\n- Who develops templates and time limits: The ESAs (i.e. including EBA) through the Joint Committee, in consultation with ENISA and the ECB, are mandated to develop (a) common draft regulatory technical standards specifying report content and time limits and (b) common draft implementing technical standards establishing standard forms, templates and procedures for reporting major ICT\u2011related incidents and notifying significant cyber threats [DORA Article 20 / 1 (a)(ii) & (b)].\n\n- Deadlines for the ESAs\u2019 draft submissions to the Commission: the ESAs were to submit the common draft regulatory technical standards further specifying classification criteria to the Commission by 17 January 2024 [DORA Article 18 / 3], and to submit the common draft regulatory and implementing technical standards referred to in Article 20 to the Commission by 17 July 2024 [DORA Article 20 / final para].\n\n- CSSF circular: the CSSF text provided prescribes that financial institutions must have incident and problem management and external communication procedures, and that timely information to supervisory authorities should be provided \u201cin line with applicable regulation\u201d (i.e. in accordance with DORA and other applicable rules), but the CSSF chunk provided does not specify particular reporting templates or concrete deadlines in the extracted paragraphs [CSSF 3.5.1 / 59\u201160; see 60.f.ii].\n\nMissing specifics\n\n- The exact content of the templates (the actual forms) and the concrete time limits/deadlines that firms must follow for initial, intermediate and final notifications are to be set by the ESAs under Article 20 but are not included in the retrieved source texts above. Therefore: Information not available in retrieved sources.",
