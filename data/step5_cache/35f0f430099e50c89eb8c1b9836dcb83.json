  "query": "What governance, risk management, and oversight responsibilities does the management body have for ICT risk, incident reporting, and third-party ICT providers under CSSF, DORA, and EBA requirements?",
  "answer": "Below is a concise, source\u2011based summary of the management body\u2019s responsibilities on governance, ICT risk management, incident reporting and oversight of third\u2011party ICT providers under the provided CSSF, DORA and EBA excerpts.\n\nGovernance (overall duties)\n- Ultimate accountability for ICT risk and digital operational resilience: the management body must bear ultimate responsibility and put in place an internal governance and control framework for ICT risk and digital operational resilience, define/approve/oversee the ICT risk management arrangements and the digital operational resilience strategy, and set policies to protect availability, integrity, confidentiality and authenticity of data [DORA Article 5 / 2(a)\u2013(b), (d); DORA Article 6 / 8(a)\u2013(c)].  \n- Ensure adequate internal governance, clear roles and responsibilities (including for ICT, information security, business continuity and control functions) and appropriate resources (staffing, skills, budget, training) to implement ICT strategy and controls [CSSF 3.2.1 / 2\u20134; DORA Article 5 / 2(c), (g), 4].  \n- Approve and periodically review ICT\u2011related policies, business continuity and response/recovery plans and ICT audit plans; receive regular reporting on ICT projects and project risks [DORA Article 5 / 2(e)\u2013(f), (g), (h); CSSF 3.6.1 / 61\u201366; CSSF 3.3.1 / 14].\n\nICT risk management (framework, roles, control, audit)\n- Require a documented, comprehensive ICT risk management framework aligned with overall risk appetite and business strategy, to be reviewed at least annually and continually improved based on lessons learned and incidents/testing [DORA Article 6 / 1, 5, 8(a)\u2013(h); CSSF 3.3.1 / 13\u201314].  \n- Assign responsibility for managing and overseeing ICT risk to an independent control function (segregated from operations) and ensure internal audit covers ICT risks; establish three\u2011lines\u2011of\u2011defence segregation as appropriate [CSSF 3.3.1 / 11; DORA Article 6 / 4, 6\u20137].  \n- Ensure monitoring, measurement, reporting mechanisms and KPIs/metrics for ICT risk and that project risks are included in the risk management framework [CSSF 3.3.1 / 10, 13(d)\u2013(e); DORA Article 6 / 8(c), (f)].\n\nIncident detection, management and reporting\n- Require an incident and problem management process (classification, roles, root\u2011cause, escalation, internal/external communication, response and recovery) and ensure the management body is informed of significant incidents (ad hoc for significant incidents and at minimum informed of impact, response and additional controls) [CSSF 3.5.1 / 59\u201360(d)(i)\u2013(ii), (e)\u2013(f)].  \n- Under DORA, ensure reporting channels at corporate level so the management body is duly informed about ICT third\u2011party arrangements, material planned changes and at least major ICT\u2011related incidents including their impact and remedial measures [DORA Article 5 / 2(i)(i)\u2013(iii)].  \n- Ensure post\u2011incident lessons feed back into the ICT risk framework and that testing/post\u2011incident conclusions are implemented [CSSF 3.3.1 / 14; DORA Article 16 / 1(g)\u2013(h)].\n\nThird\u2011party ICT providers (oversight, contracts, monitoring, exit)\n- Approve and periodically review the policy on use of ICT services by third\u2011party providers; ensure corporate reporting and a senior role or senior manager is in place to monitor arrangements and related documentation with ICT third\u2011party providers [DORA Article 5 / 2(h)\u2013(i); DORA Article 5 / 3].  \n- Require contractual arrangements that clearly allocate rights and obligations, include SLAs, security and availability requirements, incident handling and escalation, cooperation with authorities, audit/inspection rights, data location/access/return, assistance during incidents, termination/exit arrangements and transition/exit periods to preserve continuity and substitutability [DORA Article 30 / 1\u20133; CSSF 3.2.3 / 8(a)\u2013(b), 9].  \n- Monitor and seek assurance on third\u2011party compliance with the institution\u2019s security objectives and performance targets; retain rights to ongoing monitoring, inspections/audits (or agreed alternatives), and to require business contingency testing and participation in testing (e.g. TLPT) for providers of critical/important functions [CSSF 3.2.3 / 9; DORA Article 30 / 3(c)\u2013(e)].  \n- Require assessment of outsourcing criticality (impact on financial resilience, continuity, ICT/operational/legal/reputational risks, ability to audit, substitutability, reintegration, data protection) and manage aggregated exposure/concentration risk to the same provider [EBA 31 / a\u2013j; EBA 117 / 117].\n\nManagement body skills and oversight practice\n- Members must keep up\u2011to\u2011date with sufficient ICT risk knowledge and receive regular, commensurate training; the body must actively oversee management, including outsourcing risks, and ensure the institution meets authorisation and ongoing regulatory conditions [DORA Article 5 / 4; EBA 36 / a, d\u2013f].\n\nIf you want, I can extract and present the exact sentences from each cited paragraph for use in board papers or policies.",
