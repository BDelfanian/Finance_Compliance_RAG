  "query": "What are the incident notification procedures for significant cyber threats affecting EU banks according to CSSF, DORA, and EBA?",
  "answer": "Below are the incident-notification procedures, drawn only from the provided chunks.\n\nCSSF (circular 3.5.1)\n- Financial institutions must establish incident and problem management including procedures for identification, tracking, logging, categorisation and prioritisation and roles/responsibilities for incident scenarios [CSSF 3.5.1 / 59-60 / a\u2013c].\n- Incident notification and escalation: incidents with a potentially high adverse impact on critical ICT systems and ICT services must be reported to relevant senior management and ICT senior management; the management body must be informed on an ad hoc basis for significant incidents (at least on impact, response and additional controls) [CSSF 3.5.1 / 60 / d(i)-(ii)].\n- External communication: institutions must have external communication plans to collaborate with stakeholders and provide timely information to external parties (e.g. customers, other market participants, the supervisory authority) as appropriate and in line with applicable regulation [CSSF 3.5.1 / 60 / f(i)-(ii)].\n\nDORA\n- Voluntary notification of significant cyber threats: financial entities may, on a voluntary basis, notify significant cyber threats to the relevant competent authority when they deem the threat relevant to the financial system, service users or clients; national competent authorities may forward such notifications to other relevant authorities (and for significant credit institutions, to the ECB) [DORA Article 19 / para 2].\n- Classification of incidents/threats: entities must classify ICT-related incidents using criteria (affected clients/transactions, duration, geographic spread, data loss, criticality, economic impact) and must classify cyber threats as significant based on criticality of services at risk, number/relevance of clients/counterparts targeted and geographical spread; the ESAs will develop detailed thresholds/RTS [DORA Article 18 / paras 1\u20133].\n- Reporting of major incidents (distinct from voluntary significant-threat notifications): major ICT-related incidents must be reported to the relevant competent authority using the templates referred to in Article 20; entities must submit an initial notification, intermediate updates when status significantly changes, and a final report after root-cause analysis (within time limits set in Article 20) [DORA Article 19 / paras 1, 4].\n- Client notification: where a major ICT-related incident impacts clients\u2019 financial interests, entities must inform affected clients without undue delay; for significant cyber threats, entities should, where applicable, inform potentially affected clients of appropriate protection measures [DORA Article 19 / para 3].\n- Competent-authority handling and onward transmission: upon receipt of initial notification and reports, competent authorities shall in a timely manner provide incident details to EBA/ESMA/EIOPA, the ECB (where applicable), competent authorities/CSIRTs, resolution authorities and other relevant public authorities as applicable; ESAs/ECB will assess cross-border relevance and notify other Member State competent authorities as appropriate [DORA Article 19 / paras 6\u20137; Article 19 / paras 6\u20137].\n- Supervisory feedback: competent authorities shall acknowledge receipt of notifications/reports and may provide timely, proportionate feedback or high-level guidance (including anonymised intelligence on similar threats) to the reporting entity [DORA Article 22 / para 1].\n- Information sharing and notification of participation: financial entities may exchange cyber threat intelligence within trusted communities; entities shall notify competent authorities of their participation in such information-sharing arrangements upon validation of membership (or upon cessation) [DORA Article 45 / paras 1\u20133].\n- Centralisation: the ESAs (with ECB/ENISA) will assess feasibility of a single EU Hub for major-incident reporting and submit a joint report by 17 January 2025 (elements include prerequisites, interoperabilty, operational arrangements) [DORA Article 21 / paras 1\u20133].\n\nEBA\n- Information not available in retrieved sources.",
