  "query": "What are the incident notification procedures for significant cyber threats affecting EU banks according to CSSF, DORA, and EBA?\n\n",
  "answer": "Brief summary:\n\n- CSSF (Luxembourg): Financial institutions must have incident and problem management including notification and escalation procedures. Incidents with potentially high adverse impact on critical ICT systems must be reported to relevant senior and ICT senior management; significant incidents require ad hoc reporting to the management body with information on impact, response and additional controls [CSSF 3.5.1 / 3.5.1 / 60.d.i\u2013ii]. Institutions must also have external communication plans to collaborate with stakeholders and provide timely information to external parties (e.g. customers, market participants, supervisory authority) as appropriate and in line with regulation [CSSF 3.5.1 / 3.5.1 / 60.f.i\u2013ii].\n\n- DORA (EU Regulation):\n  - Classification: Financial entities must classify cyber threats as \u201csignificant\u201d based on criticality of services at risk, number/relevance of clients or counterparts targeted and geographical spread [DORA Article 18 / Article 18 / 2]. ESAs shall develop materiality thresholds and detailed criteria for significance [DORA Article 18 / Article 18 / 3].\n  - Notification (voluntary for significant cyber threats): Financial entities may voluntarily notify significant cyber threats to the relevant competent authority when they deem the threat relevant to the financial system, service users or clients; competent authorities may share such notifications with other relevant authorities (and for significant supervised credit institutions the competent authority must transmit to the ECB) [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 2; Article 19 / Article 19 / 1 (transmission to ECB) as applicable].\n  - Harmonised content and templates: The ESAs (via the Joint Committee), in consultation with ENISA and the ECB, shall develop the content of notifications for significant cyber threats and standard templates and procedures for reporting/notification [DORA Article 20 / Article 20 / first paragraph point (a)(iii) and (b)].\n  - Follow-up and onward sharing: Competent authorities receiving incident/notification reports shall timely provide details to EBA/ESMA/EIOPA, the ECB (where applicable), other competent authorities/CSIRTs, resolution authorities and other public authorities as appropriate; EBA/ESMA/EIOPA and the ECB will assess cross-border relevance and notify other Member State competent authorities as needed [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 6\u20137].\n  - Client notification: Where a major ICT-related incident impacts clients\u2019 financial interests, entities must inform affected clients without undue delay; for significant cyber threats, entities should, where applicable, inform potentially affected clients of appropriate protection measures [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / 3].\n  - Supervisory feedback: Upon receipt of initial notifications/reports, competent authorities shall acknowledge receipt and may provide timely, relevant and proportionate feedback or high-level guidance, including anonymised intelligence on similar threats [DORA Article 22 / Article 22 / 1].\n\n- EBA: Information not available in retrieved sources.",
