  "query": "Describe the requirements for outsourcing ICT services and reporting obligations for financial institutions under DORA, EBA, and CSSF.\n",
  "answer": "Summary \u2014 outsourcing ICT services\n\n- Contracts / contractual provisions\n  - DORA requires written contracts that clearly allocate rights and obligations and include SLAs; they must describe functions, subcontracting conditions, locations where services and data are processed, data protection (availability, integrity, confidentiality), access/recovery/return of data on insolvency/termination, service levels, assistance for ICT incidents, cooperation with authorities, termination rights and notice periods, participation in security awareness/training, and (for critical/important functions) quantitative SLAs, provider reporting/notice obligations, contingency testing and security measures, audit/access/inspection rights and exit/transition arrangements [DORA Article 30 / 1\u20133].\n  - CSSF requires contracts and SLAs to include appropriate proportionate information-security objectives and measures (minimum cybersecurity requirements; data life cycle; encryption, network security and monitoring; data centre locations) and operational/security incident handling procedures including escalation and reporting; firms must monitor and seek assurance on providers\u2019 compliance with their security objectives and performance targets [CSSF 3.2.3 / 8a\u2013b; 9].\n\n- Risk assessment, due diligence and governance\n  - Institutions must identify/classify outsourced functions and related data, perform a thorough risk-based analysis addressing operational, legal, ICT, compliance and reputational risks, consider location and jurisdictional factors (laws on data protection, law enforcement, insolvency), define protection levels for data confidentiality/continuity/integrity (including encryption/key management), and consider provider group status and control/influence [EBA 68 / a\u2013f; EBA 31 / a\u2013j].\n  - When outsourcing institutions must ensure they can still make business decisions and maintain orderly services; that outsourcing risks (including ICT/fintech) are identified/managed; confidentiality and information flows are ensured; and for critical/important functions they can, within an appropriate timeframe, transfer the function, reintegrate it, or discontinue dependent activities [EBA 40 / a\u2013g].\n\n- Third-country outsourcing conditions\n  - For outsourcing to a service provider in a third country of functions requiring authorisation/registration, the provider must be authorised/supervised in that third country and there must be an appropriate cooperation agreement (MoU/college) between the home competent authority and the third\u2011country supervisor assuring information access, on\u2011site access rights, timely information on breaches and cooperation on enforcement [EBA 63 / a\u2013c and c(i)\u2013(iv)].\n  - Institutions should take into account differences in national data-protection provisions and must include in outsourcing agreements obligations for the provider to protect confidential/personal data and comply with applicable data-protection/legal requirements [EBA 84 / para.1].\n\n- Special rules for critical ICT third\u2011party service providers and oversight\n  - DORA provides for designation of critical ICT third\u2011party service providers based on systemic impact, reliance, substitutability and other criteria, and establishes an oversight framework and Lead Overseers; critical providers must notify financial entities of designation and, for third\u2011country providers designated critical, may only be used if the provider establishes a Union subsidiary within 12 months of designation [DORA Article 31 / 1\u20133, 5, 9, 11\u201313].\n  - Lead Overseers can request/require information from critical ICT third\u2011party providers (contracts, audits, incident reports, subcontractor information), and must set purpose, scope and deadlines when issuing such requests or decisions [DORA Article 37 / 1\u20135].\n\nReporting obligations (ICT incidents and threats)\n\n- Major ICT\u2011related incident reporting under DORA\n  - Financial entities must report major ICT\u2011related incidents to the relevant competent authority using the templates in Article 20: an initial notification, intermediate reports when status/handling changes (and updates on request), and a final report after root\u2011cause analysis when actual impact figures are available [DORA Article 19 / 1, 4].\n  - Reports must contain enough information for competent authorities to assess significance and cross\u2011border impact; in case of technical inability to use the template, alternative means may be used [DORA Article 19 / 1].\n  - Financial entities must inform clients without undue delay if a major ICT incident affects clients\u2019 financial interests and inform potentially affected clients of appropriate protective measures in case of significant cyber threats [DORA Article 19 / 3].\n  - Financial entities may outsource the reporting obligations to a third\u2011party provider, but remain fully responsible for fulfilling incident reporting requirements [DORA Article 19 / 5].\n  - Upon receipt, competent authorities will share incident details with ESAs, the ECB (where applicable), other competent authorities/CSIRTs, resolution authorities and relevant public authorities; ESAs/ECB/ENISA will assess cross\u2011border relevance and notify other Member State authorities as appropriate [DORA Article 19 / 6\u20137, 7].\n\n- Incident handling and contractual requirements (CSSF)\n  - CSSF requires that outsourcing contracts contain operational and security incident handling procedures including escalation and reporting, and that firms monitor and seek assurance on providers\u2019 compliance with security objectives and performance targets [CSSF 3.2.3 / 8b; 9].\n\n- Oversight information requests relating to incidents\n  - The Lead Overseer may require critical ICT providers to supply incident reports and other relevant operational documents; such requests must state purpose, required information and a time limit, and decisions to require information must indicate penalties for non\u2011compliance and appeal rights [DORA Article 37 / 1\u20133, 5].\n\nIf you need consolidated checklists or the exact contractual clause wording referenced in these rules, specify which framework (DORA, EBA guidelines, or CSSF Circular) and I will extract the cited elements only.",
