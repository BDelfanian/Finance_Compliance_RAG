  "answer": "Summary of obligations\n\n1) CSSF (Luxembourg) \u2014 ICT outsourcing & third\u2011party risk (key obligations)\n- Ensure ICT and operational outsourcing complies with the institution\u2019s ICT/security risk management framework and risk\u2011mitigating measures, including when outsourcing to group entities or third parties [CSSF 3.2.3 / para 7].  \n- Contracts / SLAs must include appropriate and proportionate information\u2011security objectives and measures (e.g. minimum cybersecurity requirements; data life\u2011cycle, encryption, network security, data centre locations) and operational/security incident handling (escalation/reporting) [CSSF 3.2.3 / para 8 a\u2013b].  \n- Monitor and obtain assurance on providers\u2019 compliance with the institution\u2019s security objectives, measures and performance targets [CSSF 3.2.3 / para 9].  \n- Perform risk assessments and define/implement mitigation measures to reduce ICT/security risks to acceptable levels, considering implementation time and interim controls [CSSF 3.3.4 / paras 22\u201323].  \n- Maintain ICT operations security controls: vulnerability identification and patching, secure configuration baselines, network segmentation and encryption, endpoint protection and integrity verification, and encryption of data at rest/in transit; integrate changes into formal change management [CSSF 3.4.4 / paras 36\u201337].  \n- Maintain an ICT and security risk management framework with clear roles, an independent control function reporting to the management body, defined risk appetite, risk identification/assessment, mitigation, monitoring, incident reporting and annual review/approval by the management body [CSSF 3.3.1 / paras 10\u201314].  \n- Apply ICT project governance and programme management, including project risk assessment, security requirements approved by an independent function, representation of impacted areas, reporting to management, and inclusion of project risk in the overall risk framework [CSSF 3.6.1 / paras 61\u201366].\n\n2) DORA (EU Regulation) \u2014 contractual, oversight and ICT third\u2011party risk regime\n- Contracts with ICT third\u2011party service providers must clearly allocate rights/obligations in writing and include SLAs; must specify functions provided, subcontracting conditions, locations of processing/storage and required provider notification if locations change, data protection (availability, integrity, confidentiality), access/recovery/return of data on provider insolvency/termination, SLAs, assistance in ICT incidents, cooperation with competent/resolution authorities, termination rights, and participation in security awareness/training [DORA Article 30 / paras 1\u20132(a)\u2013(i)].  \n- Additional mandatory provisions for services supporting critical/important functions: detailed SLAs with quantitative/qualitative targets; provider notice/reporting obligations; provider requirements to implement/test contingency plans and ICT security measures; provider participation in TLPT exercises; rights to ongoing monitoring including unrestricted access/inspection/audit by the financial entity and competent authorities (and related cooperation obligations); and exit strategies with mandated transition periods to avoid disruption [DORA Article 30 / para 3 (a)\u2013(f)].  \n- Financial entities should consider use of standard contractual clauses developed by public authorities when negotiating arrangements [DORA Article 30 / para 4].  \n- Oversight framework: ESAs (via Joint Committee) and an Oversight Forum will designate critical ICT third\u2011party service providers, appoint Lead Overseers, and publish a Union\u2011level list; designation is based on systemic impact, reliance, substitutability and related criteria, and entails notification and a period for provider response [DORA Article 31 / paras 1\u20135, 9\u201311].  \n- Designated critical third\u2011party providers are subject to Union oversight; financial entities may face restrictions on using a critical provider established in a third country unless it establishes a Union subsidiary within 12 months of designation [DORA Article 31 / paras 12\u201313].  \n- DORA establishes the Oversight Forum role for coordinating ICT third\u2011party risk oversight, annual assessments, benchmarks and cooperation between ESAs and competent authorities [DORA Article 32 / paras 1\u20133, 7].  \n- DORA includes a simplified ICT risk management framework exemption for certain small/non\u2011interconnected entities but still requires documented ICT risk management, continuous monitoring, identification of key third\u2011party dependencies, business continuity and testing, and reporting on framework reviews [DORA Article 16 / paras 1\u20132].  \n- DORA contemplates international cooperation arrangements between ESAs and third\u2011country authorities on ICT third\u2011party risk and five\u2011year reporting on such cooperation [DORA Article 44 / paras 1\u20132].\n\n3) EBA guidelines \u2014 outsourcing, due diligence, risk assessment and governance\n- Outsourcing governance: institutions must apply internal governance, sound risk management and appropriate arrangements when outsourcing functions \u2014 especially critical/important functions [EBA 5].  \n- When assessing whether a function is critical/important, institutions must consider connection to authorised activities, potential impact of disruption on financial resilience, operational resilience, operational/ICT/legal/reputational risk, ability to identify/monitor/manage risks, compliance, auditability, client service impact, aggregated exposure to same provider and substitutability/reintegration ability [EBA 31 / paras a\u2013j].  \n- Institutions must be able to maintain decision\u2011making and orderly conduct of business when outsourcing; ensure outsourcing risks (including ICT/fintech) are identified, assessed, managed and mitigated; maintain confidentiality arrangements and appropriate information flows with service providers; and for critical/important functions be able, within an appropriate time frame, to transfer the function, reintegrate it, or discontinue dependent business activities [EBA 40 / paras a\u2013g].  \n- For third\u2011country service providers, outsourcing of functions requiring authorisation/registration is allowed only if the provider is authorised/supervised in the third country and there is an appropriate cooperation agreement between home competent authority and the third\u2011country supervisory authority that ensures supervisory information access, onsite access, timely information on breaches and cooperation on enforcement [EBA 63 / paras a\u2013c(i)\u2013(iv)].  \n- Due diligence and risk assessment: prior to outsourcing and during ongoing monitoring, institutions must classify functions/data by sensitivity, perform a risk\u2011based analysis addressing operational (including ICT), legal, compliance and reputational risks and oversight limitations related to provider location, assess jurisdictional consequences (laws on data protection, law enforcement, insolvency), define required data protection/continuity/integrity measures (including encryption and key management), and consider group/subsidiary relationships and control/influence over the provider [EBA 68 / paras a\u2013f].\n\nIf you need a side\u2011by\u2011side table or specific contract clause checklist drawn exclusively from these sources, state that and I will produce it using only the provided chunks.",
