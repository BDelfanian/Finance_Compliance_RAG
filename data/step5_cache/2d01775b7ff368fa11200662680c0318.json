  "answer": "Summary of reporting obligations under DORA (Article 19):\n\n- Duty to report major ICT\u2011related incidents: Financial entities must report major ICT\u2011related incidents to the relevant competent authority (Member States must designate one relevant competent authority if more than one applies) [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / paragraph 1].  \n- Special rule for significant credit institutions: Credit institutions classified as significant must report to the national competent authority which shall immediately transmit that report to the ECB [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / paragraph 1].  \n- Use of templates and possible alternative means: After collecting and analysing relevant information, entities must produce the initial notification and subsequent reports using the templates referred to in Article 20; if technical impossibility prevents using the template, notify the competent authority by alternative means [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / paragraph 1].  \n- Content requirement: The initial notification and reports must include all information necessary for the competent authority to determine the incident\u2019s significance and assess possible cross\u2011border impacts [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / paragraph 1].  \n- Optional additional transmission to CSIRTs: Member States may require that notifications (using Article 20 templates) also be provided to designated CSIRTs under Directive (EU) 2022/2555 [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / paragraph 1].  \n- Voluntary notification of significant cyber threats: Financial entities may voluntarily notify relevant competent authorities of significant cyber threats; similar transmission to the ECB applies for significant credit institutions, and Member States may require voluntary notifications to be sent to CSIRTs [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / paragraph 2].  \n- Obligation to inform clients: Where a major ICT\u2011related incident impacts clients\u2019 financial interests, entities must inform affected clients without undue delay of the incident and of mitigation measures; for significant cyber threats, entities should inform potentially affected clients of appropriate protection measures, where applicable [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / paragraph 3].  \n- Timing and types of reports: Entities must submit (within the time limits in Article 20) an initial notification, intermediate reports when status or handling changes (and updates as relevant or on competent authority request), and a final report once root\u2011cause analysis and actual impact figures are available [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / paragraph 4 (a)\u2013(c)].  \n- Outsourcing permitted but liability retained: Entities may outsource reporting to third parties under applicable law, but remain fully responsible for meeting reporting requirements [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / paragraph 5].  \n- Competent authority onward sharing: Upon receipt of notifications/reports, the competent authority shall timely provide incident details to EBA, ESMA or EIOPA; the ECB (for certain entities); competent authorities, single points of contact or CSIRTs; resolution authorities and SRB where relevant; and other relevant public authorities under national law [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / paragraph 6].  \n- Assessment and cross\u2011border notification: EBA, ESMA or EIOPA and the ECB, in consultation with ENISA and cooperating with the relevant competent authority, shall assess whether the incident is relevant to competent authorities in other Member States and notify those authorities as appropriate; the ECB shall notify Eurosystem members on payment\u2011system issues [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / paragraph 7].  \n- ESMA notification caveat: ESMA\u2019s notifications under paragraph 7 do not affect the competent authority\u2019s responsibility to urgently transmit incident details to host\u2011Member\u2011State authorities in specified central securities depository cases [DORA Article 19 / Article 19 / paragraph 8].  \n\nInformation not available in retrieved sources.",
