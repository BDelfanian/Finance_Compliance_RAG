  "query": "What are the key ICT risk management and operational resilience requirements for financial institutions under DORA, CSSF, and EBA regulations?",
  "answer": "Information below is drawn only from the provided source chunks.\n\nSummary \u2014 key requirements\n\n1) DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)\n- Have a documented, sound and comprehensive ICT risk\u2011management framework as part of overall risk management; it must protect information and ICT assets and physical infrastructures and be kept updated and available to competent authorities on request [DORA Article 6 / paras 1\u20133].\n- Governance and segregation: assign responsibility for ICT risk to a control function with appropriate independence; ensure segregation between ICT risk management, control functions and internal audit (three lines of defence) [DORA Article 6 / para 4].\n- Documentation, review and audit: document the framework, review at least annually (or periodically for microenterprises) and after major incidents; internal audit must regularly cover the ICT framework and auditors must have ICT risk expertise; establish formal follow\u2011up and remediation of critical audit findings [DORA Article 6 / paras 5\u20137].\n- Digital operational resilience strategy: include risk tolerance/impact tolerance, information security objectives/KPIs, reference architecture, detection/prevention mechanisms, testing arrangements and incident communication strategy [DORA Article 6 / para 8].\n- Protection and prevention: continuously monitor and control security/functioning of ICT systems; implement security policies, protocols and tools to ensure availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality (including secure data transfer, prevention of data corruption/loss, access limitation, strong authentication, cryptographic key protection, change management and patch policies); design network to allow instant severing/segmentation to limit contagion [DORA Article 9 / paras 1\u20134 and subparas (a)\u2013(f)].\n- Business continuity, response and recovery: maintain an ICT business continuity policy and documented response/recovery plans to ensure continuity of critical/important functions, to activate containment and recovery measures, to estimate impacts, and to coordinate communications; perform BIAs and ensure redundancy aligned to BIA [DORA Article 11 / paras 1\u20135].\n- Testing and exercises: test business continuity and response/recovery plans at least yearly (including cyber\u2011attack and switchover scenarios for non\u2011microenterprises), test crisis communication plans, maintain records of activities during disruptions, and report results or costs/losses when requested [DORA Article 11 / paras 6\u201310].\n- Digital operational resilience testing programme: implement a risk\u2011based testing programme (range of tests/methodologies), use independent testers (internal or external) avoiding conflicts of interest, prioritise and remediate findings, and ensure yearly tests on ICT systems supporting critical/important functions for non\u2011microenterprises [DORA Article 24 / paras 1\u20136].\n- Payment\u2011related incidents: the Chapter\u2019s requirements also apply to operational/security payment\u2011related incidents for credit institutions, payment institutions, AISPs and EMIs [DORA Article 23].\n\n2) CSSF (Luxembourg supervisory circular excerpts)\n- Governance, roles and risk framework: identify and manage ICT/security risks; assign a control function separated from ICT operations and accountable to the management body; ensure internal audit can independently review ICT/security activities; define roles, reporting lines, risk appetite and processes to identify/assess/mitigate/monitor/report ICT risks; document and review the framework at least annually [CSSF 3.3.1 / paras 10\u201314].\n- Risk mitigation and controls: define and implement measures to mitigate identified ICT/security risks in line with risk assessments and business processes [CSSF 3.3.4 / paras 22\u201323].\n- ICT operations security controls: implement procedures to prevent security issues and minimise impact, including vulnerability identification and patching, secure configuration baselines, network segmentation, data loss prevention, encryption of network traffic, endpoint protection and integrity verification, and encryption of data at rest and in transit (per data classification) [CSSF 3.4.4 / paras 36(a)\u2013(f), 36].\n- Change management and environment monitoring: ensure changes in operational environment are assessed and managed through a formal change management process (planned, tested, documented, authorised, deployed) [CSSF 3.4.4 / para 37].\n- Operational processes, logging, inventory and lifecycle: operate ICT based on documented/approved processes; maintain up\u2011to\u2011date ICT asset inventory (configurations, interdependencies, location, classification, ownership); implement logging and monitoring for critical operations; manage ICT asset lifecycles, support and patching, and performance/capacity planning [CSSF 3.4.7 / paras 50\u201356, 52\u201356].\n- Backups and restoration: define backups/restoration procedures aligned to business recovery needs and perform periodic testing; store backups securely and remote from primary site [CSSF 3.4.7 / paras 57\u201358].\n- Training and awareness: implement a training programme including at least annual security awareness training for all staff and contractors [CSSF 3.4.7 / para 49].\n- Incident and problem management: establish incident/problem management processes to monitor/log incidents, classify by priority/business criticality, define roles/responsibilities, perform root\u2011cause analysis and problem management, ensure internal escalation and management reporting, define incident response procedures and external communication plans (including reporting to senior management, management body and external stakeholders) [CSSF 3.5.1 / paras 59\u201360 and subparas a\u2013f].\n\n3) EBA (selected guidance/excerpts)\n- Outsourcing / third\u2011party concentration and criticality: when assessing outsourcing, consider connection to core activities, potential impact of disruption on financial resilience, business continuity, operational/ICT/legal/reputational risks, ability to monitor/manage risks and conduct audits, aggregated exposure to same provider, substitutability and ability to reintegrate services, data protection and confidentiality (including GDPR) [EBA 31 / points a\u2013j].\n- Penetration testing and ICT security controls: institutions should be able to carry out security penetration testing to assess effectiveness of cyber and ICT security measures; payment institutions should have internal ICT control mechanisms including ICT security controls and mitigation measures [EBA 94].\n- Concentration risk monitoring by supervisors: where concentration risks (e.g., reliance on same third parties) are identified, competent authorities should monitor development and evaluate impacts on other institutions and market stability and inform resolution authorities about potentially critical functions [EBA 117].\n\nIf you want, I can extract specific quoted requirements into a checklist mapped to each regulation.",
