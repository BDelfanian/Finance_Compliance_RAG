  "query": "Describe the requirements for outsourcing ICT services and reporting obligations for financial institutions under DORA, EBA, and CSSF.",
  "answer": "Below I summarize, using only the retrieved source chunks, the outsourcing (ICT third\u2011party) requirements and the reporting obligations for financial institutions under DORA, the EBA guidelines and the CSSF guidance. Citations are given inline to the exact source paragraphs.\n\n1) DORA \u2014 outsourcing/contractual requirements (key points)\n- Contracts must allocate rights and obligations in writing and include the full SLA in a durable format [DORA Article 30 / paragraph 1].  \n- Required contractual elements (minimum) include: a full description of functions/ICT services and whether subcontracting is permitted; locations/regions where services and data are processed (and a prior\u2011notice requirement for location changes); provisions on availability/authenticity/integrity/confidentiality of data; access/recovery/return of personal and non\u2011personal data in the event of insolvency/termination; service level descriptions; obligation of the provider to assist the financial entity during ICT incidents; obligation to cooperate with competent and resolution authorities; termination rights and minimum notice periods; and participation conditions in the financial entity\u2019s security awareness/training [DORA Article 30 / paragraph 2 (a)\u2013(i)].  \n- Additional mandatory contractual elements when the ICT service supports critical or important functions: full SLAs with precise quantitative/qualitative targets; notice periods and reporting obligations by the provider for developments materially affecting service delivery; requirements that the provider implement and test business contingency plans and security measures; obligation to participate in and cooperate in TLPT exercises; broad rights to monitor including unrestricted access, inspection and audit by the financial entity (or appointed third party) and by competent authorities; and exit strategies with mandatory transition periods to avoid disruption and permit migration or reintegration [DORA Article 30 / paragraph 3 (a)\u2013(f)].  \n- Parties should consider use of standard contractual clauses developed by public authorities [DORA Article 30 / paragraph 4].  \n- Oversight/third\u2011party designation: DORA establishes a process to designate certain ICT third\u2011party providers as \u201ccritical\u201d, with criteria focusing on systemic impact, reliance and substitutability; designated critical providers are subject to oversight (Lead Overseer appointment) and financial entities\u2019 use of a third\u2011country provider designated as critical is subject to additional rules (e.g. requirement that provider establish an EU subsidiary within 12 months) [DORA Article 31 / paragraphs 1\u20133, 9, 12].  \n- Lead Overseer information powers: the Lead Overseer may request or require submission of documents, contracts, ICT security audit reports, incident reports and information on sub\u2011outsourced parties; the request/decision must state purpose, what is required and a time limit; and the provider remains responsible if information is incomplete or misleading [DORA Article 37 / paragraphs 1\u20135].\n\n2) DORA \u2014 incident reporting obligations (key points)\n- Financial entities must report major ICT\u2011related incidents to the relevant competent authority, using the templates referred to in Article 20, producing an initial notification and subsequent reports (intermediate updates and a final report after root\u2011cause analysis) containing all information necessary for the authority to assess significance and cross\u2011border impact [DORA Article 19 / paragraphs 1, 4].  \n- Time limits for submission follow Article 20 (templates/timelines) and alternative means may be used in case of technical impossibility [DORA Article 19 / paragraph 1].  \n- Financial entities may voluntarily notify significant cyber threats to the competent authority; competent authorities may share such notifications with other authorities [DORA Article 19 / paragraph 2].  \n- Where a major ICT incident impacts clients\u2019 financial interests, financial entities must inform affected clients without undue delay of the incident and mitigation measures; for significant cyber threats, where applicable, they should inform potentially affected clients of protection measures to consider [DORA Article 19 / paragraph 3].  \n- Financial entities may outsource the reporting obligations to a third\u2011party provider but remain fully responsible for fulfilling the incident reporting requirements [DORA Article 19 / paragraph 5].  \n- Upon receipt of incident reports the competent authority will share details, as appropriate, with EBA/ESMA/EIOPA, the ECB (where applicable), other competent authorities/CSIRTs, resolution authorities and other relevant public authorities; ESAs/ECB/ENISA/competent authorities will assess cross\u2011border relevance and notify other Member State authorities as needed [DORA Article 19 / paragraphs 6\u20137].\n\n3) EBA guidelines \u2014 outsourcing (key points from retrieved chunks)\n- High\u2011level requirements when outsourcing: institutions/payment institutions should ensure they retain ability to take and implement decisions regarding their business activities and critical/important functions; maintain orderly conduct of business and services; adequately identify, assess, manage and mitigate outsourcing risks (including ICT/fintech); maintain appropriate confidentiality arrangements and an appropriate flow of relevant information with service providers; and for outsourced critical/important functions be able, within an appropriate time frame, to (i) transfer the function to alternative providers, (ii) reintegrate the function, or (iii) discontinue the dependent business activities [EBA 40 / para 40.a\u2013g].  \n- Third\u2011country outsourcing conditions: outsourcing to a service provider located in a third country that performs functions requiring authorisation or registration in the Member State is permitted only if (a) the provider is authorised/registered and supervised in that third country, (b) there is an appropriate cooperation agreement (e.g. MoU/college) between relevant supervisory authorities, and (c) that cooperation agreement enables the competent authorities to obtain information, access relevant data/documents/premises/personnel, receive timely information on apparent breaches and cooperate on enforcement (details at points i\u2013iv) [EBA 63 / para 63.a\u2013c and 63.c(i)\u2013(iv)].  \n- Risk assessment and due diligence: before and during outsourcing, institutions must identify and classify functions/data/systems, perform a thorough risk\u2011based analysis addressing operational/ICT/legal/compliance/reputational risks and oversight limitations related to locations of services/data, consider consequences of provider location and political/security/legal/insolvency environments, define appropriate data protection and continuity measures (including encryption where necessary), consider provider group relationships and degree of control/influence, and assess substitutability, reintegration ability and aggregated exposure to the same provider [EBA 68 / para 68.a\u2013f; EBA 31 / para 31.a\u2013j].  \n- Data protection/confidentiality: outsourcing agreements must include the provider\u2019s obligation to protect confidential/personal/sensitive information and to comply with the legal data protection requirements applicable to the institution (e.g. GDPR) and any national confidentiality duties (e.g. banking secrecy) [EBA 84 / para 84].  \n\nNote on EBA reporting obligations: the retrieved EBA chunks supplied above (EBA 40, 63, 68, 31, 84) set out outsourcing governance, third\u2011country conditions, risk assessment, due diligence and data protection requirements, and supervisory cooperation provisions for third\u2011country cases, but do not include a detailed incident\u2011reporting regime for ICT incidents in the provided excerpts. Therefore, specific EBA incident\u2011reporting obligations (timelines/templates/contents) are not present in the retrieved EBA chunks.\n\n4) CSSF (selected requirements in the retrieved chunks)\n- General requirement: financial institutions must ensure the effectiveness of risk\u2011mitigating measures defined in their risk management framework when operational functions of payment services and/or ICT services and ICT systems are outsourced (including to group entities) and when using third parties [CSSF 3.2.3 / para 7].  \n- Contracts and SLAs (normal and disruption scenarios) with providers (outsourcing providers, group entities or third parties) should include: appropriate and proportionate information\u2011security objectives and measures (minimum cybersecurity requirements); specifications of the institution\u2019s data life\u2011cycle; requirements regarding data encryption, network security and security monitoring processes; and the location of data centres [CSSF 3.2.3 / para 8.a]. Contracts/SLAs should also include operational and security incident handling procedures including escalation and reporting [CSSF 3.2.3 / para 8.b].  \n- Financial institutions should monitor and seek assurance on providers\u2019 compliance with the institution\u2019s security objectives, measures and performance targets [CSSF 3.2.3 / para 9].  \n- ICT operations security expectations: institutions should implement procedures to prevent security issues and minimise impacts, including (at least) vulnerability identification and remediation (patching/updating), secure configuration baselines, network segmentation and data loss prevention, encryption of network traffic (per data classification), endpoint protection and access control for endpoints, verification of integrity of software/firmware/data, and encryption of data at rest and in transit; and changes affecting the operational environment should follow a formal change management process (planned, tested, documented, authorised, deployed) [CSSF 3.4.4 / para 36.a\u2013f; para 37].  \n\n5) Cross\u2011references and responsibilities\n- DORA expressly allows outsourcing of the reporting obligation but preserves the financial entity\u2019s full responsibility for reporting compliance [DORA Article 19 / paragraph 5].  \n- DORA provides powerful supervisory/oversight measures (designation of critical ICT third\u2011party providers, Lead Overseer powers to request information, cooperation with ESAs/ENISA/competent authorities) that affect oversight of outsourced ICT providers and the availability of information to supervisors [DORA Article 31 / paragraphs 1\u20135, 9; Article 37 / paragraphs 1\u20135; Article 19 / paragraphs 6\u20137].  \n- The CSSF guidance stresses contractual security requirements, incident handling and monitoring/assurance of providers [CSSF 3.2.3 / paras 7\u20139; CSSF 3.4.4 / paras 36\u201337].  \n- The EBA guidelines require robust risk assessment, due diligence, ability to substitute/reintegrate critical functions, third\u2011country supervisory cooperation and contractual/data protection obligations [EBA 31 / para 31.a\u2013j; EBA 68 / para 68.a\u2013f; EBA 63 / para 63.a\u2013c; EBA 40 / para 40.a\u2013g; EBA 84 / para 84].\n\nIf you want, I can extract or quote specific sub\u2011clauses (e.g. the full list of Article 30 paragraph 2 items, or the Article 19 paragraph numbers for each reporting step) from any of the above DORA/CSSF/EBA chunks. If you need EBA incident\u2011reporting rules, note that those specific reporting details are not present in the retrieved EBA source chunks.",
