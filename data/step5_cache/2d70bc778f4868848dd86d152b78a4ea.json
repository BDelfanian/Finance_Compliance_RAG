  "query": "What are the key ICT risk management and operational resilience requirements for financial institutions under DORA, CSSF, and EBA regulations?\n",
  "answer": "Below I summarise the key ICT risk\u2011management and operational\u2011resilience requirements that appear in the retrieved DORA, CSSF and EBA source chunks. All statements are limited to the provided text and cited inline.\n\nDORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)\n- Requirement to maintain a sound, comprehensive, documented ICT risk\u2011management framework as part of overall risk management to ensure high digital operational resilience [DORA Article 6 / 1].  \n- Framework must protect information and ICT assets (software, hardware, data centres, premises) from damage and unauthorised access [DORA Article 6 / 2].  \n- Minimise ICT risk impact by deploying strategies, policies, procedures, protocols and tools; provide information to competent authorities on request [DORA Article 6 / 3].  \n- Assign a control function for ICT risk management (except microenterprises), ensure independence and segregation of ICT risk, control and audit functions (three lines of defence) [DORA Article 6 / 4].  \n- Documented framework: review at least annually or after major ICT incidents and continuously improve; report review to supervisor on request [DORA Article 6 / 5].  \n- Internal audit of ICT risk management for non\u2011microenterprises, with auditors having ICT expertise; follow\u2011up and remediation of critical audit findings [DORA Article 6 / 6\u20117].  \n- Must include a digital operational resilience strategy describing how the framework is implemented, including risk tolerance, information security objectives/KPIs, reference architecture, incident detection/prevention mechanisms, testing, and communication strategy for reportable incidents [DORA Article 6 / 8].  \n- May define multi\u2011vendor strategies and may outsource verification tasks but remain fully responsible for compliance [DORA Article 6 / 9\u201110].  \n- Require a digital operational resilience testing programme (risk\u2011based) covering a range of assessments/tools, independent testers (internal or external) with conflict\u2011of\u2011interest safeguards, prioritisation/remediation procedures, and at least yearly tests for ICT systems supporting critical/important functions [DORA Article 24 / 1\u20116].  \n- Capabilities to gather intelligence on vulnerabilities/threats; conduct post\u2011incident reviews after major ICT incidents and communicate changes to competent authorities on request; incorporate lessons from testing and incidents into ICT risk assessment [DORA Article 13 / 1\u20113].  \n- Monitor effectiveness of resilience strategy and map ICT risk evolution; senior ICT staff must report yearly to management body on findings [DORA Article 13 / 4\u20115].  \n- Develop mandatory ICT security awareness and resilience training for staff (complexity commensurate with role) and include third\u2011party providers where appropriate [DORA Article 13 / 6].  \n- Continuous monitoring and control of ICT systems; design and implement ICT security policies, procedures and tools to ensure availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of data; specific requirements for information security policy, network/infrastructure management, access limitation, strong authentication/cryptographic key protection, change management and patch management; network design allowing segmentation/severing to prevent contagion [DORA Article 9 / 1\u20114 and subpoints (a)\u2013(f)].\n\nCSSF (selected CSSF circular excerpts)\n- Governance and roles: identify and manage ICT/security risks; assign a control function independent from ICT operations, accountable to the management body; internal audit to independently review ICT/security activities [CSSF 3.3.1 / 10\u201111].  \n- Define and assign key roles, reporting lines and integrate ICT/security risk management into overall risk management; set risk appetite and include processes to identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report ICT/security risks; review and approve framework at least yearly [CSSF 3.3.1 / 12\u201114].  \n- Risk mitigation: determine and implement measures based on risk assessments to reduce ICT/security risks to acceptable levels and adapt business processes or controls as needed [CSSF 3.3.4 / 22\u201123].  \n- ICT operations security: implement measures to identify and remediate vulnerabilities (patching, updates), secure configuration baselines, network segmentation, data\u2011loss prevention, encryption of traffic, endpoint protection, integrity verification, encryption at rest/in transit, and integrate changes into formal change\u2011management processes (planned, tested, documented, authorised, deployed) [CSSF 3.4.4 / 36 a\u2013f; 37].  \n- ICT operations processes and controls: documented/approved processes for operating, monitoring and controlling ICT systems; maintain up\u2011to\u2011date ICT asset inventory with configurations and interdependencies; logging/monitoring for critical operations; lifecycle management and patching; performance and capacity planning; secure offsite backups and periodic testing of restoration [CSSF 3.4.7 / 50\u201158].  \n- Information security training and awareness: establish training and periodic security awareness programmes for all staff and contractors, at least annually [CSSF 3.4.7 / 49].  \n- Incident and problem management: establish incident/process to monitor/log incidents, classify by priority, define roles/responsibilities, perform root\u2011cause analysis and problem management, internal escalation and notification to senior management and management body for significant incidents, incident response to restore service, and external communications/coordination as appropriate [CSSF 3.5.1 / 59\u201160].\n\nEBA (selected guidelines/excerpts)\n- Penetration/security testing: institutions should, where relevant, be able to carry out security penetration testing to assess effectiveness of cyber/ICT security measures; payment institutions should have internal ICT control mechanisms [EBA 94 / 94].  \n- Outsourcing and third\u2011party risk: when outsourcing, institutions must ensure they retain decision\u2011making over business and critical/important functions, maintain orderly conduct of business, identify/assess/manage ICT/fintech and other outsourcing risks, ensure confidentiality and information flows, and for critical functions be able to transfer, reintegrate or discontinue the affected function within an appropriate timeframe [EBA 40 / 40 a\u2013f].  \n- Assessing whether an outsourced function is critical/important requires consideration of impact on financial resilience, business continuity/operational resilience, operational risk including ICT, reputational risk, ability to identify/manage risks, compliance, auditability, aggregated exposure to same provider, substitutability, reintegration ability, data protection and GDPR compliance [EBA 31 / 31 a\u2013j].  \n- Competent authorities should monitor concentration risks in critical functions and evaluate potential market/systemic impacts; inform resolution authority where appropriate [EBA 117 / 117].\n\nIf you want, I can extract these points into a side\u2011by\u2011side checklist (DORA vs CSSF vs EBA) with direct paragraph citations for each checklist item.",
