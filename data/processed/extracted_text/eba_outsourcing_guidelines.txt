FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
Guidelines on outsourcing
Title I – Proportionality: group application and
institutional protection schemes
1 Proportionality
18. Institutions, payment institutions and competent authorities should, when complying or
supervising compliance with these guidelines, have regard to the principle of proportionality.
The proportionality principle aims to ensure that governance arrangements, including those
related to outsourcing, are consistent with the individual risk profile, the nature and business
model of the institution or payment institution, and the scale and complexity of their activities
so that the objectives of the regulatory requirements are effectively achieved.
19. When applying the requirements set out in these guidelines, institutions and payment
institutions should take into account the complexity of the outsourced functions, the risks
arising from the outsourcing arrangement, the criticality or importance of the outsourced
function and the potential impact of the outsourcing on the continuity of their activities.
20. When applying the principle of proportionality, institutions, payment institutions31 and
competent authorities should take into account the criteria specified in Title I of the EBA
Guidelines on internal governance in line with Article 74(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU.
2 Outsourcing by groups and institutions that are members of an
institutional protection scheme
21. In accordance with Article 109 (2) of Directive2013/36/EU, these guidelines should also apply
on a sub-consolidated and consolidated basis, taking into account the prudential scope of
consolidation.32 For this purpose, the EU parent undertakings or the parent undertaking in a
Member State should ensure that internal governance arrangements, processes and
mechanisms in their subsidiaries, including payment institutions, are consistent, well integrated
and adequate for the effective application of these guidelines at all relevant levels.
31 Payment institutions should also refer to the EBA guidelines under PSD2 on the information to be provided for the
authorisation of payment institutions and electronic money institutions and the registration of account information
service providers, which are available on the EBA’s website under the following link:
https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on-security-
measures-for-operational-and-security-risks-under-the-psd2
32 Please refer to Article 4(1) points (47) and (48) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 regarding the scope of consolidation.
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
22. Institutions and payment institutions, in accordance with paragraph 21, and institutions that,
as members of an institutional protection scheme, use centrally provided governance
arrangements should comply with the following:
a. where those institutions or payment institutions have outsourcing arrangements with
service providers within the group or the institutional protection scheme33, the
management body of those institutions or payment institutions retains, also for these
outsourcing arrangements, full responsibility for compliance with all regulatory
requirements and the effective application of these guidelines;
b. where those institutions or payment institutions outsource the operational tasks of
internal control functions to a service provider within the group or the institutional
protection scheme, for the monitoring and auditing of outsourcing arrangements,
institutions should ensure that, also for these outsourcing arrangements, those
operational tasks are effectively performed, including through the receiving of
appropriate reports.
23. In addition to paragraph 22, institutions and payment institutions within a group for which no
waivers have been granted on the basis of Article 109 of Directive 2013/36/EU and Article 7 of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions that are a central body or that are permanently
affiliated to a central body for which no waivers have been granted on the basis of Article 21 of
Directive 2013/36/EU, or institutions that are members of an institutional protection scheme
should take into account the following:
a. where the operational monitoring of outsourcing is centralised (e.g. as part of a master
agreement for the monitoring of outsourcing arrangements), institutions and payment
institutions should ensure that, at least for outsourced critical or important functions,
both independent monitoring of the service provider and appropriate oversight by
each institution or payment institution is possible, including by receiving, at least
annually and upon request from the centralised monitoring function, reports that
include, at least, a summary of the risk assessment and performance monitoring. In
addition, institutions and payment institutions should receive from the centralised
monitoring function a summary of the relevant audit reports for critical or important
outsourcing and, upon request, the full audit report;
b. institutions and payment institutions should ensure that their management body will
be duly informed of relevant planned changes regarding service providers that are
monitored centrally and the potential impact of these changes on the critical or
important functions provided, including a summary of the risk analysis, including legal
risks, compliance with regulatory requirements and the impact on service levels, in
order for them to assess the impact of these changes;
33 In accordance with Article 113(7) CRR, institutional protection scheme means a contractual or statutory liability
arrangement which protects those institutions that are a member of the scheme and in particular ensures their liquidity
and solvency to avoid bankruptcy where necessary.
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
c. where those institutions and payment institutions within the group, institutions
affiliated to a central body or institutions that are part of an institutional protection
scheme rely on a central pre-outsourcing assessment of outsourcing arrangements, as
referred to in Section 12, each institution and payment institution should receive a
summary of the assessment and ensure that it takes into consideration its specific
structure and risks within the decision-making process;
d. where the register of all existing outsourcing arrangements, as referred to in
Section 11, is established and maintained centrally within a group or institutional
protection scheme, competent authorities, all institutions and payment institutions
should be able to obtain their individual register without undue delay. This register
should include all outsourcing arrangements, including outsourcing arrangements with
service providers inside that group or institutional protection scheme;
e. where those institutions and payment institutions rely on an exit plan for a critical or
important function that has been established at group level, within the institutional
protection scheme or by the central body, all institutions and payment institutions
should receive a summary of the plan and be satisfied that the plan can be effectively
executed.
24. Where waivers have been granted pursuant to Article 21 of Directive 2013/36/EU or
Article 109(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU in conjunction with Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No
575/2013, the provisions of these guidelines should be applied by the parent undertaking in a
Member State for itself and its subsidiaries or by the central body and its affiliates as a whole.
25. Institutions and payment institutions that are subsidiaries of an EU parent undertaking or of a
parent undertaking in a Member State to which no waivers have been granted on the basis of
Article 21 of Directive 2013/36/EU or Article 109(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU in conjunction with
Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should ensure that they comply with these Guidelines
on an individual basis.
Title II – Assessment of outsourcing arrangements
3 Outsourcing
26. Institutions and payment institutions should establish whether an arrangement with a third
party falls under the definition of outsourcing. Within this assessment, consideration should be
given to whether the function (or a part thereof) that is outsourced to a service provider is
performed on a recurrent or an ongoing basis by the service provider and whether this function
(or part thereof) would normally fall within the scope of functions that would or could
realistically be performed by institutions or payment institutions, even if the institution or
payment institution has not performed this function in the past itself.
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
27. Where an arrangement with a service provider covers multiple functions, institutions and
payment institutions should consider all aspects of the arrangement within their assessment,
e.g. if the service provided includes the provision of data storage hardware and the backup of
data, both aspects should be considered together.
28. As a general principle, institutions and payment institutions should not consider the following
as outsourcing:
a. a function that is legally required to be performed by a service provider, e.g. statutory
audit;
b. market information services (e.g. provision of data by Bloomberg, Moody’s, Standard
& Poor’s, Fitch);
c. global network infrastructures (e.g. Visa, MasterCard);
d. clearing and settlement arrangements between clearing houses, central counterparties
and settlement institutions and their members;
e. global financial messaging infrastructures that are subject to oversight by relevant
authorities;
f. correspondent banking services; and
g. the acquisition of services that would otherwise not be undertaken by the institution
or payment institution (e.g. advice from an architect, providing legal opinion and
representation in front of the court and administrative bodies, cleaning, gardening and
maintenance of the institution’s or payment institution’s premises, medical services,
servicing of company cars, catering, vending machine services, clerical services, travel
services, post-room services, receptionists, secretaries and switchboard operators),
goods (e.g. plastic cards, card readers, office supplies, personal computers, furniture)
or utilities (e.g. electricity, gas, water, telephone line).
4 Critical or important functions
29. Institutions and payment institutions should always consider a function as critical or important
in the following situations:34
a. where a defect or failure in its performance would materially impair:
i. their continuing compliance with the conditions of their authorisation or its
other obligations under Directive 2013/36/EU, Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,
34 See also Article 30 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 of 25 April 2016 supplementing Directive
2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements and operating
conditions for investment firms and defined terms for the purposes of that Directive.
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
Directive 2014/65/EU, Directive (EU) 2015/2366 and Directive 2009/110/EC and
their regulatory obligations;
ii. their financial performance; or
iii. the soundness or continuity of their banking and payment services and
activities;
b. when operational tasks of internal control functions are outsourced, unless the
assessment establishes that a failure to provide the outsourced function or the
inappropriate provision of the outsourced function would not have an adverse impact
on the effectiveness of the internal control function;
c. when they intend to outsource functions of banking activities or payment services to
an extent that would require authorisation35 by a competent authority, as referred to
in Section 12.1.
30. In the case of institutions, particular attention should be given to the assessment of the
criticality or importance of functions if the outsourcing concerns functions related to core
business lines and critical functions as defined in Article 2(1)(35) and 2(1)(36) of Directive
2014/59/EU36 and identified by institutions using the criteria set out in Articles 6 and 7 of
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/778.37 Functions that are necessary to perform
activities of core business lines or critical functions should be considered as critical or important
functions for the purpose of these guidelines, unless the institution’s assessment establishes
that a failure to provide the outsourced function or the inappropriate provision of the
outsourced function would not have an adverse impact on the operational continuity of the
core business line or critical function.
31. When assessing whether an outsourcing arrangement relates to a function that is critical or
important, institutions and payment institutions should take into account, together with the
outcome of the risk assessment outlined in Section 12.2, at least the following factors:
a. whether the outsourcing arrangement is directly connected to the provision of banking
activities or payment services38 for which they are authorised;
35 See the activities listed in Annex I of Directive 2013/36/EU.
36 Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the

extraordinary ex post contributions may be partially or entirely deferred, and on the criteria for the determination of the
activities, services and operations with regard to critical functions, and for the determination of the business lines and
associated services with regard to core business lines (OJ L 131, 20.5.2016, p. 41).

b. the potential impact of any disruption to the outsourced function or failure of the
service provider to provide the service at the agreed service levels on a continuous
basis on their:
i. short- and long-term financial resilience and viability, including, if applicable, its
assets, capital, costs, funding, liquidity, profits and losses;
ii. business continuity and operational resilience;

ii. comply with all legal and regulatory requirements;
iii. conduct appropriate audits regarding the outsourced function;
d. the potential impact on the services provided to its clients;
e. all outsourcing arrangements, the institution’s or payment institution’s aggregated
exposure to the same service provider and the potential cumulative impact of
outsourcing arrangements in the same business area;
f. the size and complexity of any business area affected;
g. the possibility that the proposed outsourcing arrangement might be scaled up without
replacing or revising the underlying agreement;
h. the ability to transfer the proposed outsourcing arrangement to another service
provider, if necessary or desirable, both contractually and in practice, including the
estimated risks, impediments to business continuity, costs and time frame for doing so
(‘substitutability’);
i. the ability to reintegrate the outsourced function into the institution or payment
institution, if necessary or desirable;

persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive
95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
Title III – Governance framework
5 Sound governance arrangements and third-party risk
32. As part of the overall internal control framework,40 including internal control mechanisms,41
institutions and payment institutions should have a holistic institution-wide risk management
framework extending across all business lines and internal units. Under that framework,
institutions and payment institutions should identify and manage all their risks, including risks
caused by arrangements with third parties. The risk management framework should also
enable institutions and payment institutions to make well-informed decisions on risk-taking
and ensure that risk management measures are appropriately implemented, including with
regard to cyber risks.42
33. Institutions and payment institutions, taking into account the principle of proportionality in line
with Section 1, should identify, assess, monitor and manage all risks resulting from
arrangements with third parties to which they are or might be exposed, regardless of whether
or not those arrangements are outsourcing arrangements. The risks, in particular the
operational risks, of all arrangements with third parties, including the ones referred to in
paragraphs 26 and 28, should be assessed in line with Section 12.2.
34. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that they comply with all requirements
under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, including for their third-party and outsourcing arrangements.
6 Sound governance arrangements and outsourcing
35. The outsourcing of functions cannot result in the delegation of the management body’s
responsibilities. Institutions and payment institutions remain fully responsible and accountable
for complying with all of their regulatory obligations, including the ability to oversee the
outsourcing of critical or important functions.
36. The management body is at all times fully responsible and accountable for at least:
a. ensuring that the institution or payment institution meets on an ongoing basis the
conditions with which it must comply to remain authorised, including any conditions
imposed by the competent authority;
b. the internal organisation of the institution or the payment institution;
40 Institutions should refer to Title V of the EBA guidelines on internal governance.
41 Please also refer to Article 11 of Directive 2015/2366 (PSD2).
42 See also EBA guidelines on ICT and security risk management (https://eba.europa.eu/-/eba-consults-on-guidelines-on-
ict-and-security-risk-management) and G7 fundamental elements for third-party cyber risk management in the financial
sector (https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/g7-fundamental-elements-cybersecurity-financial-sector_en).
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
c. the identification, assessment and management of conflicts of interest;
d. the setting of the institution’s or payment institution’s strategies and policies (e.g. the
business model, the risk appetite, the risk management framework);
e. overseeing the day-to-day management of the institution or payment institution,
including the management of all risks associated with outsourcing; and
f. the oversight role of the management body in its supervisory function, including
overseeing and monitoring management decision-making.
37. Outsourcing should not lower the suitability requirements applied to the members of an
institution’s management body, directors and persons responsible for the management of the
payment institution and key function holders. Institutions and payment institutions should
have adequate competence and sufficient and appropriately skilled resources to ensure
appropriate management and oversight of outsourcing arrangements.
38. Institutions and payment institutions should:
a. clearly assign the responsibilities for the documentation, management and control of
outsourcing arrangements;
b. allocate sufficient resources to ensure compliance with all legal and regulatory
requirements, including these guidelines and the documentation and monitoring of all
outsourcing arrangements;
c. taking into account Section 1 of these guidelines, establish an outsourcing function or
designate a senior staff member who is directly accountable to the management body
(e.g. a key function holder of a control function) and responsible for managing and
overseeing the risks of outsourcing arrangements as part of the institutions internal
control framework and overseeing the documentation of outsourcing arrangements.
Small and less complex institutions or payment institutions should at least ensure a
clear division of tasks and responsibilities for the management and control of
outsourcing arrangements and may assign the outsourcing function to a member of
the institution’s or payment institution’s management body.
39. Institutions and payment institutions should maintain at all times sufficient substance and not

FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
7 Outsourcing policy
41. The management body of an institution or payment institution44 that has outsourcing
arrangements in place or plans on entering into such arrangements should approve, regularly
review and update a written outsourcing policy and ensure its implementation, as applicable,
on an individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated basis. For institutions, the outsourcing
policy should be in accordance with Section 8 of the EBA’s Guidelines on internal governance
and, in particular, should take into account the requirements set out in Section 18 (new
products and significant changes) of those guidelines. Payment institutions may also align their
policies with Sections 8 and 18 of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance.
42. The policy should include the main phases of the life cycle of outsourcing arrangements and
define the principles, responsibilities and processes in relation to outsourcing. In particular, the
policy should cover at least:
a. the responsibilities of the management body in line with paragraph 36, including its
involvement, as appropriate, in the decision-making on outsourcing of critical or
important functions;
b. the involvement of business lines, internal control functions and other individuals in
respect of outsourcing arrangements;
c. the planning of outsourcing arrangements, including:
i. the definition of business requirements regarding outsourcing arrangements;
ii. the criteria, including those referred to in Section 4, and processes for
identifying critical or important functions;
iii. risk identification, assessment and management in accordance with
Section 12.2;
iv. due diligence checks on prospective service providers, including the measures
required under Section 12.3;
v. procedures for the identification, assessment, management and mitigation of
potential conflicts of interest, in accordance with Section 8;
vi. business continuity planning in accordance with Section 9;
vii. the approval process of new outsourcing arrangements;
44 See also the EBA guidelines on the security measures for operational and security risks of payment services under PSD2,

money/guidelines-on-security-measures-for-operational-and-security-risks-under-the-psd2
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
d. the implementation, monitoring and management of outsourcing arrangements,
including:
i. the ongoing assessment of the service provider’s performance in line with
Section 14;
ii. the procedures for being notified and responding to changes to an outsourcing
arrangement or service provider (e.g. to its financial position, organisational or
ownership structures, sub-outsourcing);
iii. the independent review and audit of compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements and policies;
iv. the renewal processes;
e. the documentation and record-keeping, taking into account the requirements in
Section 11;
f. the exit strategies and termination processes, including a requirement for a
documented exit plan for each critical or important function to be outsourced where
such an exit is considered possible taking into account possible service interruptions or
the unexpected termination of an outsourcing agreement.
43. The outsourcing policy should differentiate between the following:
a. outsourcing of critical or important functions and other outsourcing arrangements;
b. outsourcing to service providers that are authorised by a competent authority and
those that are not;
c. intragroup outsourcing arrangements, outsourcing arrangements within the same
institutional protection scheme (including entities fully owned individually or
collectively by institutions within the institutional protection scheme) and outsourcing
to entities outside the group; and
d. outsourcing to service providers located within a Member State and third countries.
44. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that the policy covers the identification of
the following potential effects of critical or important outsourcing arrangements and that these
are taken into account in the decision-making process:
a. the institution’s risk profile;
b. the ability to oversee the service provider and to manage the risks;
c. the business continuity measures; and
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
d. the performance of their business activities.
8 Conflicts of interests
45. Institutions, in line with Title IV, Section 11, of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance,45 and
payment institutions should identify, assess and manage conflicts of interests with regard to
their outsourcing arrangements.
46. Where outsourcing creates material conflicts of interest, including between entities within the
same group or institutional protection scheme, institutions and payment institutions need to
take appropriate measures to manage those conflicts of interest.
47. When functions are provided by a service provider that is part of a group or a member of an
institutional protection scheme or that is owned by the institution, payment institution, group
or institutions that are members of an institutional protection scheme, the conditions, including
financial conditions, for the outsourced service should be set at arm’s length. However, within
the pricing of services synergies resulting from providing the same or similar services to several
institutions within a group or an institutional protection scheme may be factored in, as long as
the service provider remains viable on a stand-alone basis; within a group this should be
irrespective of the failure of any other group entity.
9 Business continuity plans
48. Institutions, in line with the requirements under Article 85(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU and
Title VI of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance,46 and payment institutions should have
in place, maintain and periodically test appropriate business continuity plans with regard to
outsourced critical or important functions. Institutions and payment institutions within a group
or institutional protection scheme may rely on centrally established business continuity plans
regarding their outsourced functions.
49. Business continuity plans should take into account the possible event that the quality of the
provision of the outsourced critical or important function deteriorates to an unacceptable level
or fails. Such plans should also take into account the potential impact of the insolvency or other
failures of service providers and, where relevant, political risks in the service provider’s
jurisdiction.
45 Payment institutions may also align their policies with those guidelines.

FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
10 Internal audit function
50. The internal audit function’s47 activities should cover, following a risk-based approach, the
independent review of outsourced activities. The audit plan48 and programme should include,
in particular, the outsourcing arrangements of critical or important functions.
51. With regard to the outsourcing process, the internal audit function should at least ascertain:
a. that the institution’s or payment institution’s framework for outsourcing, including the
outsourcing policy, is correctly and effectively implemented and is in line with the
applicable laws and regulation, the risk strategy and the decisions of the management
body;
b. the adequacy, quality and effectiveness of the assessment of the criticality or
importance of functions;
c. the adequacy, quality and effectiveness of the risk assessment for outsourcing
arrangements and that the risks remain in line with the institution’s risk strategy;
d. the appropriate involvement of governance bodies; and
e. the appropriate monitoring and management of outsourcing arrangements.
11 Documentation requirements
52. As part of their risk management framework, institutions and payment institutions should
maintain an updated register of information on all outsourcing arrangements at the institution
and, where applicable, at sub-consolidated and consolidated levels, as set out in Section 2, and
should appropriately document all current outsourcing arrangements, distinguishing between
the outsourcing of critical or important functions and other outsourcing arrangements. Taking
into account national law, institutions should maintain the documentation of ended
outsourcing arrangements within the register and the supporting documentation for an
appropriate period.
53. Taking into account Title I of these guidelines, and under the conditions set out in
paragraph 23(d), for institutions and payment institutions within a group, institutions
permanently affiliated to a central body or institutions that are members of the same
institutional protection scheme, the register may be kept centrally.
47 Regarding the responsibilities of the internal audit function, institutions should refer to Section 22 of the EBA Guidelines
on internal governance (https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/internal-governance/guidelines-on-internal-
governance-revised-) and payment institutions should refer to Guideline 5 of the EBA guidelines on the authorisation of
payment institutions

Title IV – Outsourcing process
12 Pre-outsourcing analysis
61. Before entering into any outsourcing arrangement, institutions and payment institutions
should:
a. assess if the outsourcing arrangement concerns a critical or important function, as set
out in Title II;
b. assess if the supervisory conditions for outsourcing set out in Section 12.1 are met;
c. identify and assess all of the relevant risks of the outsourcing arrangement in

banking activities51 or payment services, to an extent that the performance of that function
requires authorisation or registration by a competent authority in the Member State where
they are authorised, to a service provider located in the same or another Member State takes
place only if one of the following conditions is met:
50 See also the EBA Guidelines on major incident reporting under PSD2, available under:
https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/payment-services-and-electronic-money/guidelines-on-major-
incidents-reporting-under-psd2
51 See Article 9 CRD with regard to the prohibition of persons or undertakings other than credit institutions from carrying
out the business of taking deposits or other repayable funds from the public.
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
a. the service provider is authorised or registered by a competent authority to
perform such banking activities or payment services; or
b. the service provider is otherwise allowed to carry out those banking activities or
payment services in accordance with the relevant national legal framework.
63. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that the outsourcing of functions of
banking activities or payment services, to an extent that the performance of that function
requires authorisation or registration by a competent authority in the Member State where
they are authorised, to a service provider located in a third country takes place only if the
following conditions are met:
a. the service provider is authorised or registered to provide that banking activity or
payment service in the third country and is supervised by a relevant competent
authority in that third country (referred to as a ‘supervisory authority’);
b. there is an appropriate cooperation agreement, e.g. in the form of a memorandum
of understanding or college agreement, between the competent authorities
responsible for the supervision of the institution and the supervisory authorities
responsible for the supervision of the service provider; and
c. the cooperation agreement referred to in point (b) should ensure that the
competent authorities are able, at least, to:
i. obtain, upon request, the information necessary to carry out their
supervisory tasks pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU, Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,
Directive (EU) 2015/2366 and Directive 2009/110/EC;
ii. obtain appropriate access to any data, documents, premises or personnel
in the third country that are relevant for the performance of their supervisory
powers;

enforcement in the case of a breach of the applicable regulatory requirements and
national law in the Member State. Cooperation should include, but not necessarily
be limited to, receiving information on potential breaches of the applicable
regulatory requirements from the supervisory authorities in the third country as
soon as is practicable.
12.2 Risk assessment of outsourcing arrangements
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
64. Institutions and payment institutions should assess the potential impact of outsourcing
arrangements on their operational risk, should take into account the assessment results when
deciding if the function should be outsourced to a service provider and should take appropriate
steps to avoid undue additional operational risks before entering into outsourcing
arrangements.
65. The assessment should include, where appropriate, scenarios of possible risk events, including
high-severity operational risk events. Within the scenario analysis, institutions and payment
institutions should assess the potential impact of failed or inadequate services, including the
risks caused by processes, systems, people or external events. Institutions and payment
institutions, taking into account the principle of proportionality referred to in Section 1, should
document the analysis performed and their results and should estimate the extent to which
the outsourcing arrangement would increase or decrease their operational risk. Taking into
account Title I, small and non-complex institutions and payment institutions may use
qualitative risk assessment approaches, while large or complex institutions should have a more
sophisticated approach, including, where available, the use of internal and external loss data
to inform the scenario analysis.
66. Within the risk assessment, institutions and payments institutions should also take into account
the expected benefits and costs of the proposed outsourcing arrangement, including weighing
any risks that may be reduced or better managed against any risks that may arise as a result of
the proposed outsourcing arrangement, taking into account at least:
a. concentration risks, including from:
i. outsourcing to a dominant service provider that is not easily substitutable; and
ii. multiple outsourcing arrangements with the same service provider or closely
connected service providers;
b. the aggregated risks resulting from outsourcing several functions across the institution
or payment institution and, in the case of groups of institutions or institutional
protection schemes, the aggregated risks on a consolidated basis or on the basis of the
institutional protection scheme;
c. in the case of significant institutions, the step-in risk, i.e. the risk that may result from
the need to provide financial support to a service provider in distress or to take over its
business operations; and
d. the measures implemented by the institution or payment institution and by the service
provider to manage and mitigate the risks.
67. Where the outsourcing arrangement includes the possibility that the service provider sub-
outsources critical or important functions to other service providers, institutions and payment
institutions should take into account:
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
a. the risks associated with sub-outsourcing, including the additional risks that may arise
if the sub-contractor is located in a third country or a different country from the service
provider;
b. the risk that long and complex chains of sub-outsourcing reduce the ability of
institutions or payment institutions to oversee the outsourced critical or important
function and the ability of competent authorities to effectively supervise them.
68. When carrying out the risk assessment prior to outsourcing and during ongoing monitoring of
the service provider’s performance, institutions and payment institutions should, at least:
a. identify and classify the relevant functions and related data and systems as regards
their sensitivity and required security measures;
b. conduct a thorough risk-based analysis of the functions and related data and systems
that are being considered for outsourcing or have been outsourced and address the
potential risks, in particular the operational risks, including legal, ICT, compliance and
reputational risks, and the oversight limitations related to the countries where the
outsourced services are or may be provided and where the data are or are likely to be
stored;
c. consider the consequences of where the service provider is located (within or outside
the EU);
d. consider the political stability and security situation of the jurisdictions in question,
including:
i. the laws in force, including laws on data protection;
ii. the law enforcement provisions in place; and
iii. the insolvency law provisions that would apply in the event of a service provider’s
failure and any constraints that would arise in respect of the urgent recovery of
the institution’s or payment institution’s data in particular;
e. define and decide on an appropriate level of protection of data confidentiality, of
continuity of the activities outsourced and of the integrity and traceability of data and
systems in the context of the intended outsourcing. Institutions and payment
institutions should also consider specific measures, where necessary, for data in transit,
data in memory and data at rest, such as the use of encryption technologies in
combination with an appropriate key management architecture;
f. consider whether the service provider is a subsidiary or parent undertaking of the
institution, is included in the scope of accounting consolidation or is a member of or
owned by institutions that are members of an institutional protection scheme and, if
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
so, the extent to which the institution controls it or has the ability to influence its
actions in line with Section 2.
12.3 Due diligence
69. Before entering into an outsourcing arrangement and considering the operational risks related
to the function to be outsourced, institutions and payment institutions should ensure in their
selection and assessment process that the service provider is suitable.
70. With regard to critical and important functions, institutions and payment institutions should
ensure that the service provider has the business reputation, appropriate and sufficient
abilities, the expertise, the capacity, the resources (e.g. human, IT, financial), the organisational
structure and, if applicable, the required regulatory authorisation(s) or registration(s) to
perform the critical or important function in a reliable and professional manner to meet its
obligations over the duration of the draft contract.
71. Additional factors to be considered when conducting due diligence on a potential service
provider include, but are not limited to:
a. its business model, nature, scale, complexity, financial situation, ownership and group
structure;
b. the long-term relationships with service providers that have already been assessed and
perform services for the institution or payment institution;
c. whether the service provider is a parent undertaking or subsidiary of the institution or
payment institution, is part of the accounting scope of consolidation of the institution
or is a member of or is owned by institutions that are members of the same institutional
protection scheme to which the institution belongs;
d. whether or not the service provider is supervised by competent authorities.
72. Where outsourcing involves the processing of personal or confidential data, institutions and
payment institutions should be satisfied that the service provider implements appropriate
technical and organisational measures to protect the data.
73. Institutions and payment institutions should take appropriate steps to ensure that service
providers act in a manner consistent with their values and code of conduct. In particular, with
regard to service providers located in third countries and, if applicable, their sub-contractors,
institutions and payment institutions should be satisfied that the service provider acts in an
ethical and socially responsible manner and adheres to international standards on human rights
(e.g. the European Convention on Human Rights), environmental protection and appropriate
working conditions, including the prohibition of child labour.
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
13 Contractual phase
74. The rights and obligations of the institution, the payment institution and the service provider
should be clearly allocated and set out in a written agreement.
75. The outsourcing agreement for critical or important functions should set out at least:
a. a clear description of the outsourced function to be provided;
b. the start date and end date, where applicable, of the agreement and the notice periods
for the service provider and the institution or payment institution;
c. the governing law of the agreement;
d. the parties’ financial obligations;
e. whether the sub-outsourcing of a critical or important function, or material parts
thereof, is permitted and, if so, the conditions specified in Section 13.1 that the sub-
outsourcing is subject to;
f. the location(s) (i.e. regions or countries) where the critical or important function will
be provided and/or where relevant data will be kept and processed, including the
possible storage location, and the conditions to be met, including a requirement to
notify the institution or payment institution if the service provider proposes to change
the location(s);
g. where relevant, provisions regarding the accessibility, availability, integrity, privacy and
safety of relevant data, as specified in Section 13.2;
h. the right of the institution or payment institution to monitor the service provider’s

performance targets for the outsourced function to allow for timely monitoring so that
appropriate corrective action can be taken without undue delay if the agreed service
levels are not met;
j. the reporting obligations of the service provider to the institution or payment
institution, including the communication by the service provider of any development
that may have a material impact on the service provider’s ability to effectively carry out
the critical or important function in line with the agreed service levels and in
compliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements and, as appropriate, the
obligations to submit reports of the internal audit function of the service provider;
k. whether the service provider should take mandatory insurance against certain risks
and, if applicable, the level of insurance cover requested;
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
l. the requirements to implement and test business contingency plans;
m. provisions that ensure that the data that are owned by the institution or payment
institution can be accessed in the case of the insolvency, resolution or discontinuation
of business operations of the service provider;
n. the obligation of the service provider to cooperate with the competent authorities and
resolution authorities of the institution or payment institution, including other persons
appointed by them;
o. for institutions, a clear reference to the national resolution authority’s powers,
especially to Articles 68 and 71 of Directive 2014/59/EU (BRRD), and in particular a
description of the ‘substantive obligations’ of the contract in the sense of Article 68 of
that Directive;
p. the unrestricted right of institutions, payment institutions and competent authorities
to inspect and audit the service provider with regard to, in particular, the critical or
important outsourced function, as specified in Section 13.3;
q. termination rights, as specified in Section 13.4.
13.1 Sub-outsourcing of critical or important functions
76. The outsourcing agreement should specify whether or not sub-outsourcing of critical or
important functions, or material parts thereof, is permitted.
77. If sub-outsourcing of critical or important functions is permitted, institutions and payment
institutions should determine whether the part of the function to be sub-outsourced is, as such,
critical or important (i.e. a material part of the critical or important function) and, if so, record
it in the register.
78. If sub-outsourcing of critical or important functions is permitted, the written agreement should:
a. specify any types of activities that are excluded from sub-outsourcing;
b. specify the conditions to be complied with in the case of sub-outsourcing;
c. specify that the service provider is obliged to oversee those services that it has sub-
contracted to ensure that all contractual obligations between the service provider and
the institution or payment institution are continuously met;
d. require the service provider to obtain prior specific or general written authorisation
from the institution or payment institution before sub-outsourcing data;52
52 See Article 28 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
e. include an obligation of the service provider to inform the institution or payment
institution of any planned sub-outsourcing, or material changes thereof, in particular
where that might affect the ability of the service provider to meet its responsibilities
under the outsourcing agreement. This includes planned significant changes of sub-
contractors and to the notification period; in particular, the notification period to be
set should allow the outsourcing institution or payment institution at least to carry out
a risk assessment of the proposed changes and to object to changes before the planned
sub-outsourcing, or material changes thereof, come into effect;
f. ensure, where appropriate, that the institution or payment institution has the right to
object to intended sub-outsourcing, or material changes thereof, or that explicit
approval is required;
g. ensure that the institution or payment institution has the contractual right to terminate
the agreement in the case of undue sub-outsourcing, e.g. where the sub-outsourcing
materially increases the risks for the institution or payment institution or where the
service provider sub-outsources without notifying the institution or payment
institution.
79. Institutions and payment institutions should agree to sub-outsourcing only if the sub-
contractor undertakes to:
a. comply with all applicable laws, regulatory requirements and contractual obligations;
and
b. grant the institution, payment institution and competent authority the same
contractual rights of access and audit as those granted by the service provider.
80. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that the service provider appropriately
oversees the sub-service providers, in line with the policy defined by the institution or payment
institution. If the sub-outsourcing proposed could have material adverse effects on the
outsourcing arrangement of a critical or important function or would lead to a material increase
of risk, including where the conditions in paragraph 79 would not be met, the institution or
payment institution should exercise its right to object to the sub-outsourcing, if such a right
was agreed, and/or terminate the contract.
13.2 Security of data and systems
81. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that service providers, where relevant,
comply with appropriate IT security standards.
82. Where relevant (e.g. in the context of cloud or other ICT outsourcing), institutions and payment
institutions should define data and system security requirements within the outsourcing
agreement and monitor compliance with these requirements on an ongoing basis.
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
83. In the case of outsourcing to cloud service providers and other outsourcing arrangements that
involve the handling or transfer of personal or confidential data, institutions and payment
institutions should adopt a risk-based approach to data storage and data processing location(s)
(i.e. country or region) and information security considerations.
84. Without prejudice to the requirements under the Regulation (EU) 2016/679, institutions and
payment institutions, when outsourcing (in particular to third countries), should take into
account differences in national provisions regarding the protection of data. Institutions and
payment institutions should ensure that the outsourcing agreement includes the obligation
that the service provider protects confidential, personal or otherwise sensitive information and
complies with all legal requirements regarding the protection of data that apply to the
institution or payment institution (e.g. the protection of personal data and that banking secrecy
or similar legal confidentiality duties with respect to clients’ information, where applicable, are
observed).
13.3 Access, information and audit rights
85. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure within the written outsourcing
arrangement that the internal audit function is able to review the outsourced function using a
risk-based approach.
86. Regardless of the criticality or importance of the outsourced function, the written outsourcing
arrangements between institutions and service providers should refer to the information
gathering and investigatory powers of competent authorities and resolution authorities under
Article 63(1)(a) of Directive 2014/59/EU and Article 65(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU with regard
to service providers located in a Member State and should also ensure those rights with regard
to service providers located in third countries.
87. With regard to the outsourcing of critical or important functions, institutions and payment
institutions should ensure within the written outsourcing agreement that the service provider
grants them and their competent authorities, including resolution authorities, and any other
person appointed by them or the competent authorities, the following:
a. full access to all relevant business premises (e.g. head offices and operation centres),
including the full range of relevant devices, systems, networks, information and data
used for providing the outsourced function, including related financial information,
personnel and the service provider’s external auditors (‘access and information
rights’); and
b. unrestricted rights of inspection and auditing related to the outsourcing arrangement
(‘audit rights’), to enable them to monitor the outsourcing arrangement and to ensure
compliance with all applicable regulatory and contractual requirements.
88. For the outsourcing of functions that are not critical or important, institutions and payment
institutions should ensure the access and audit rights as set out in paragraph 87 (a) and (b) and
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
Section 13.3, on a risk-based approach, considering the nature of the outsourced function and
the related operational and reputational risks, its scalability, the potential impact on the
continuous performance of its activities and the contractual period. Institutions and payment
institutions should take into account that functions may become critical or important over time.
89. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that the outsourcing agreement or any
other contractual arrangement does not impede or limit the effective exercise of the access
and audit rights by them, competent authorities or third parties appointed by them to exercise
these rights.
90. Institutions and payment institutions should exercise their access and audit rights, determine
the audit frequency and areas to be audited on a risk-based approach and adhere to relevant,
commonly accepted, national and international audit standards.53
91. Without prejudice to their final responsibility regarding outsourcing arrangements, institutions
and payment institutions may use:
a. pooled audits organised jointly with other clients of the same service provider, and
performed by them and these clients or by a third party appointed by them, to use
audit resources more efficiently and to decrease the organisational burden on both the
clients and the service provider;
b. third-party certifications and third-party or internal audit reports, made available by
the service provider.
92. For the outsourcing of critical or important functions, institutions and payment institutions
should assess whether third-party certifications and reports as referred to in paragraph 91(b)
are adequate and sufficient to comply with their regulatory obligations and should not rely
solely on these reports over time.
93. Institutions and payment institutions should make use of the method referred to in
paragraph 91(b) only if they:
a. are satisfied with the audit plan for the outsourced function;
b. ensure that the scope of the certification or audit report covers the systems (i.e.
processes, applications, infrastructure, data centres, etc.) and key controls identified
by the institution or payment institution and the compliance with relevant regulatory
requirements;
c. thoroughly assess the content of the certifications or audit reports on an ongoing basis
and verify that the reports or certifications are not obsolete;
53 For institutions, please refer to Section 22 of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance:

11%29.pdf/eb859955-614a-4afb-bdcd-aaa664994889
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
d. ensure that key systems and controls are covered in future versions of the certification
or audit report;
e. are satisfied with the aptitude of the certifying or auditing party (e.g. with regard to
rotation of the certifying or auditing company, qualifications, expertise, re-
performance/verification of the evidence in the underlying audit file);
f. are satisfied that the certifications are issued and the audits are performed against
widely recognised relevant professional standards and include a test of the operational
effectiveness of the key controls in place;
g. have the contractual right to request the expansion of the scope of the certifications or
audit reports to other relevant systems and controls; the number and frequency of such
requests for scope modification should be reasonable and legitimate from a risk
management perspective; and
h. retain the contractual right to perform individual audits at their discretion with regard
to the outsourcing of critical or important functions.
94. In line with the EBA Guidelines on ICT risk assessment under the SREP, institutions should,
where relevant, ensure that they are able to carry out security penetration testing to assess the
effectiveness of implemented cyber and internal ICT security measures and processes.54 Taking
into account Title I, payment institutions should also have internal ICT control mechanisms,
including ICT security control and mitigation measures.
95. Before a planned on-site visit, institutions, payment institutions, competent authorities and
auditors or third parties acting on behalf of the institution, payment institution or competent
authorities should provide reasonable notice to the service provider, unless this is not possible
due to an emergency or crisis situation or would lead to a situation where the audit would no
longer be effective.
96. When performing audits in multi-client environments, care should be taken to ensure that risks
to another client’s environment (e.g. impact on service levels, availability of data,
confidentiality aspects) are avoided or mitigated.
97. Where the outsourcing arrangement carries a high level of technical complexity, for instance in
the case of cloud outsourcing, the institution or payment institution should verify that whoever
is performing the audit – whether it is its internal auditors, the pool of auditors or external
auditors acting on its behalf – has appropriate and relevant skills and knowledge to perform
relevant audits and/or assessments effectively. The same applies to any staff of the institution
or payment institution reviewing third-party certifications or audits carried out by service
providers.

FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
13.4 Termination rights
98. The outsourcing arrangement should expressly allow the possibility for the institution or
payment institution to terminate the arrangement, in accordance with applicable law, including
in the following situations:
a. where the provider of the outsourced functions is in a breach of applicable law,
regulations or contractual provisions;
b. where impediments capable of altering the performance of the outsourced function
are identified;
c. where there are material changes affecting the outsourcing arrangement or the service
provider (e.g. sub-outsourcing or changes of sub-contractors);
d. where there are weaknesses regarding the management and security of confidential,
personal or otherwise sensitive data or information; and
e. where instructions are given by the institution’s or payment institution’s competent
authority, e.g. in the case that the competent authority is, caused by the outsourcing
arrangement, no longer in a position to effectively supervise the institution or payment
institution.
99. The outsourcing arrangement should facilitate the transfer of the outsourced function to
another service provider or its re-incorporation into the institution or payment institution. To
this end, the written outsourcing arrangement should:
a. clearly set out the obligations of the existing service provider, in the case of a transfer
of the outsourced function to another service provider or back to the institution or
payment institution, including the treatment of data;
b. set an appropriate transition period, during which the service provider, after the
termination of the outsourcing arrangement, would continue to provide the
outsourced function to reduce the risk of disruptions; and
c. include an obligation of the service provider to support the institution or payment
institution in the orderly transfer of the function in the event of the termination of the
outsourcing agreement.
14 Oversight of outsourced functions
100. Institutions and payment institutions should monitor, on an ongoing basis, the
performance of the service providers with regard to all outsourcing arrangements on a risk-
based approach and with the main focus being on the outsourcing of critical or important
functions, including that the availability, integrity and security of data and information is
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
ensured. Where the risk, nature or scale of an outsourced function has materially changed,
institutions and payment institutions should reassess the criticality or importance of that
function in line with Section 4.
101. Institutions and payment institutions should apply due skill, care and diligence when
monitoring and managing outsourcing arrangements.
102. Institutions should regularly update their risk assessment in accordance with
Section 12.2and should periodically report to the management body on the risks identified in
respect of the outsourcing of critical or important functions.
103. Institutions and payment institutions should monitor and manage their internal
concentration risks caused by outsourcing arrangements, taking into account Section 12.2 of
these guidelines.
104. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure, on an ongoing basis, that outsourcing
arrangements, with the main focus being on outsourced critical or important functions, meet
appropriate performance and quality standards in line with their policies by:
a. ensuring that they receive appropriate reports from service providers;
b. evaluating the performance of service providers using tools such as key performance
indicators, key control indicators, service delivery reports, self-certification and
independent reviews; and
c. reviewing all other relevant information received from the service provider, including
reports on business continuity measures and testing.
105. Institutions should take appropriate measures if they identify shortcomings in the provision
of the outsourced function. In particular, institutions and payment institutions should follow
up on any indications that service providers may not be carrying out the outsourced critical or
important function effectively or in compliance with applicable laws and regulatory
requirements. If shortcomings are identified, institutions and payment institutions should take
appropriate corrective or remedial actions. Such actions may include terminating the
outsourcing agreement, with immediate effect, if necessary.
15 Exit strategies
106. Institutions and payment institutions should have a documented exit strategy when
outsourcing critical or important functions that is in line with their outsourcing policy and
business continuity plans,55 taking into account at least the possibility of:
55 Institutions, in line with the requirements under Article 85(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU and Title VI of the EBA Guidelines
on internal governance, and payment institutions should have appropriate business continuity plans in place with regard
to the outsourcing of critical or important functions.
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
a. the termination of outsourcing arrangements;
b. the failure of the service provider;
c. the deterioration of the quality of the function provided and actual or potential
business disruptions caused by the inappropriate or failed provision of the function;
d. material risks arising for the appropriate and continuous application of the function.
107. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that they are able to exit outsourcing
arrangements without undue disruption to their business activities, without limiting their
compliance with regulatory requirements and without any detriment to the continuity and
quality of its provision of services to clients. To achieve this, they should:
a. develop and implement exit plans that are comprehensive, documented and, where
appropriate, sufficiently tested (e.g. by carrying out an analysis of the potential costs,
impacts, resources and timing implications of transferring an outsourced service to an
alternative provider); and
b. identify alternative solutions and develop transition plans to enable the institution or
payment institution to remove outsourced functions and data from the service
provider and transfer them to alternative providers or back to the institution or
payment institution or to take other measures that ensure the continuous provision of
the critical or important function or business activity in a controlled and sufficiently
tested manner, taking into account the challenges that may arise because of the
location of data and taking the necessary measures to ensure business continuity
during the transition phase.
108. When developing exit strategies, institutions and payment institutions should:
a. define the objectives of the exit strategy;
b. perform a business impact analysis that is commensurate with the risk of the
outsourced processes, services or activities, with the aim of identifying what human
and financial resources would be required to implement the exit plan and how much
time it would take;
c. assign roles, responsibilities and sufficient resources to manage exit plans and the
transition of activities;
d. define success criteria for the transition of outsourced functions and data; and
e. define the indicators to be used for the monitoring of the outsourcing arrangement (as
outlined under Section 14), including indicators based on unacceptable service levels
that should trigger the exit.
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
Title V – Guidelines on outsourcing addressed to competent
authorities
109. When establishing appropriate methods to monitor institutions’ and payment institutions’
compliance with the conditions for initial authorisation, competent authorities should aim to
identify if outsourcing arrangements amount to a material change to the conditions and
obligations of institutions’ and payment institutions’ initial authorisation.
110. Competent authorities should be satisfied that they can effectively supervise institutions
and payment institutions, including that institutions or payment institutions have ensured
within their outsourcing arrangement that service providers are obliged to grant audit and
access rights to the competent authority and the institution, in line with Section 13.3.
111. The analysis of institutions’ outsourcing risks should be performed at least within the SREP
or, with regard to payment institutions, as part of other supervisory processes, including ad-
hoc requests, or during on-site inspections.
112. Further to the information recorded within the register, as referred to in Section 11,
competent authorities may ask institutions and payment institutions for additional
information, in particular for critical or important outsourcing arrangements, such as:
a. the detailed risk analysis;
b. whether the service provider has a business continuity plan that is suitable for the
services provided to the outsourcing institution or payment institution;
c. the exit strategy for use if the outsourcing arrangement is terminated by either party
or if there is disruption to the provision of the services; and
d. the resources and measures in place to adequately monitor the outsourced activities.
113. In addition to the information required under Section 11, competent authorities may
require institutions and payment institutions to provide detailed information on any
outsourcing arrangement, even if the function concerned is not considered critical or
important.
114. Competent authorities should assess the following on a risk-based approach:
a. whether institutions and payment institutions monitor and manage appropriately, in
particular, critical or important outsourcing arrangements;
b. whether institutions and payment institutions have sufficient resources in place to
monitor and manage outsourcing arrangements;
c. whether institutions and payment institutions identify and manage all relevant risks;
and
FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
d. whether institutions and payment institutions identify, assess and appropriately
manage conflicts of interest with regard to outsourcing arrangements, e.g. in the case
of intragroup outsourcing or outsourcing within the same institutional protection
scheme.
115. Competent authorities should ensure that EU/EEA institutions and payment institutions are
not operating as an ‘empty shell’, including situations where institutions use back-to-back
transactions or intragroup transactions to transfer part of the market risk and credit risk to a
non-EU/EEA entity, and should ensure that they have appropriate governance and risk
management arrangements in place to identify and manage their risks.
116. Within their assessment, competent authorities should take into account all risks, in
particular:56
a. the operational risks57 posed by the outsourcing arrangement;
b. reputational risks;
c. the step-in risk that could require the institution to bail out a service provider, in the
case of significant institutions;
d. concentration risks within the institution, including on a consolidated basis, caused by
multiple outsourcing arrangements with a single service provider or closely connected
service providers or multiple outsourcing arrangements within the same business area;
e. concentration risks at the sector level, e.g. where multiple institutions or payment
institutions make use of a single service provider or a small group of service providers;
f. the extent to which the outsourcing institution or payment institution controls the
service provider or has the ability to influence its actions, the reduction of risks that
may result from a higher level of control and if the service provider is included in the
consolidated supervision of the group; and
g. conflicts of interest between the institution and the service provider.
117. Where concentration risks are identified, competent authorities should monitor the
development of such risks and evaluate both their potential impact on other institutions and
payment institutions and the stability of the financial market; competent authorities should
inform, where appropriate, the resolution authority about new potentially critical functions58
that have been identified during this assessment.

FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING
118. Where concerns are identified that lead to the conclusion that an institution or payment
institution no longer has robust governance arrangements in place or does not comply with
regulatory requirements, competent authorities should take appropriate actions, which may
include limiting or restricting the scope of the outsourced functions or requiring exit from one
or more outsourcing arrangements. In particular, taking into account the need of the institution
or payment institution to operate on a continuous basis, the cancellation of contracts could be
required if the supervision and enforcement of regulatory requirements cannot be ensured by
other measures.
119. Competent authorities should be satisfied that they are able to perform effective
supervision, in particular when institutions and payment institutions outsource critical or
important functions that are undertaken outside the EU/EEA.
