Accompanying documents 56\n5.1 Draft cost-benefit analysis/impact assessment 56\n5.2 Feedback on the public consultation 68\nSummary of responses to the consultation and of the EBA’s analysis 71\nExecutive summary\nTrust in the reliability of the financial system is crucial for its proper functioning and is a prerequisite\nif it is to contribute to the economy as a whole. Effective internal governance arrangements are\nfundamental if institutions individually and the financial system they form as a whole are to operate\nwell.\nOver recent years, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in outsourcing business\nactivities also in order to reduce costs and improve their flexibility and efficiency. In the context of\ndigitalisation and the increasing importance of new financial technology (fintech) providers,\nfinancial institutions are adapting their business models to embrace such technologies. Some have\nintensified the use of fintech solutions and have launched projects to improve their cost efficiency\nalso in response to the intermediation margins of the traditional banking business model being put\nunder pressure by the low interest rate environment. Outsourcing is a way to get relatively easy\naccess to new technologies and to achieve economies of scale.\nDirective 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive; CRD) strengthens the governance\nrequirements for institutions and Article 74(3) CRD gives the EBA the mandate to develop\nguidelines on institutions’ governance arrangements. Outsourcing is one of the specific aspects of\ninstitutions’ governance arrangements. Directive 2014/65/EU (Markets in Financial Instruments\nDirective; MiFID II) contains explicit provisions regarding the outsourcing of functions in the field of\ninvestment services and activities. Directive 2015/2366/EU (Revised Payment Service Directive;\nPSD2) sets out requirements for the outsourcing of functions by payment institutions.\nThe EBA is updating the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) guidelines on\noutsourcing that were issued in 2006, which applied exclusively to credit institutions; the aim is to\nestablish a more harmonised framework for all financial institutions that are within the scope of\nthe EBA’s mandate, namely credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRD, as well as\npayment and electronic money institutions. The guidelines set out specific provisions for these\nfinancial institutions’ governance frameworks with regard to their outsourcing arrangements and\nthe related supervisory expectations and processes. The recommendation on outsourcing to cloud\nservice providers, published in December 2017, has been integrated into the guidelines.\nEach financial institution’s management body remains responsible for that institution and all of its\nactivities, at all times; to this end, the management body should ensure that sufficient resources\nare available to appropriately support and ensure the performance of those responsibilities,\nincluding overseeing all risks and managing the outsourcing arrangements. Outsourcing must not\nlead to a situation in which an institution becomes an ‘empty shell’ that lacks the substance to\nremain authorised.\nWith regard to outsourcing to service providers located in third countries, financial institutions are\nexpected to take particular care that compliance with EU legislation and regulatory requirements\n(e.g. professional secrecy, access to information and data, protection of personal data) is ensured\nand that the competent authority is able to effectively supervise financial institutions, in particular\nregarding critical or important functions outsourced to service providers.\nThe guidelines set out which arrangements with third parties are to be considered as outsourcing\nand provide criteria for the identification of critical or important functions that have a strong impact\non the financial institution’s risk profile or on its internal control framework. If such critical or\nimportant functions are outsourced, stricter requirements apply to these outsourcing\narrangements than to other outsourcing arrangements.\nCompetent authorities are required to effectively supervise financial institutions’ outsourcing\narrangements, including identifying and monitoring risk concentrations at individual service\nproviders and assessing whether or not such concentrations could pose a risk to the stability of the\nfinancial system. To identify such risk concentrations, competent authorities should be able to rely\non comprehensive documentation on outsourcing arrangements compiled by financial institutions.\nNext steps\nThe guidelines will enter into force on 30 September 2019. The 2006 guidelines on outsourcing and\nthe EBA’s recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers will be repealed at the same\ntime.\nBackground"

It is used only for the\npurpose of identifying ‘critical or important functions’ under outsourcing arrangements to which\na specific set of requirements apply. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 specifies,\nunder Article 30, that ‘an operational function shall be regarded as critical or important where\na defect or failure in its performance would materially impair the continuing compliance of an\ninvestment firm with the conditions and obligations of its authorisation or its other obligations\nunder Directive 2014/65/EU, or its financial performance, or the soundness or the continuity of\nits investment services and activities’. The same approach exists under Directive 2009/138/EC12\n(Solvency II), while, in the context of outsourcing, the PSD2 uses ‘important function’ for the\npurpose of identifying functions under outsourcing arrangements for which specific\nrequirements apply. Therefore, to embrace all existing legislation and to ensure a level playing\nfield for credit institutions, investment firms, payment institutions and electronic money\ninstitutions, the wording used under MiFID II is used within the guidelines. It should be noted\n10 Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a\nCommission Decision 2009/78/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 12).\n11 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 of 25 April 2016 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European\nParliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements and operating conditions for investment firms and\ndefined terms for the purposes of that Directive.\n12 Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit\nof the business of Insurance and Reinsurance\nthat the definition of ‘critical or important function’ for the purpose of outsourcing used in these\nguidelines is different from the definition of ‘critical functions’ under Article 2(1)(35) BRRD."

    "text": "5. Accompanying documents\n5.1 Draft cost-benefit analysis/impact assessment\nArticle 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n(the EBA Regulation) provides that the EBA should carry out an analysis of ‘the potential related\ncosts and benefits’ of any guidelines it develops. This analysis should provide an overview of the\nfindings regarding the problem to be dealt with, the solutions proposed and the potential impact\nof these options.\nA. Problem identification\nThe CEBS guidelines on outsourcing, published in 2006, were applicable exclusively to credit\ninstitutions and needed to be replaced by EBA guidelines applicable to all institutions and payment\ninstitutions to establish a more harmonised framework for the outsourcing arrangements of all\nfinancial institutions in the scope of the EBA’s action. The update was also necessary to take into\naccount changes within EU legislation. In addition, outsourcing to third countries may change in\nvolume after the UK’s notification of its intention to leave the EU. Furthermore, the scope and\nnature of outsourcing arrangements have changed over time and, in particular, the outsourcing of\nIT processes and infrastructures became more common. High concentrations of IT services at a\nlimited number of service providers have the potential to lead to risks for the stability of the\nfinancial market, particularly if no additional safeguards would be implemented.\nB. Policy objectives\nTo ensure a level playing field and to meet the requirements of the CRD, PSD2 and EMD, the EBA is\nnow updating the guidelines issued by its predecessor to establish one common framework for the\noutsourcing of all financial institutions within the scope of the EBA’s action.\nTo cater for the principle of proportionality and in accordance with the approach taken in the MiFID\nII and PSD2, the guidelines require that the outsourcing of critical or important functions be\nidentified and impose stricter requirements on such outsourcing compared with other outsourcing\narrangements.\nThe guidelines aim to clarify the supervisory expectations regarding outsourcing to service\nproviders, including service providers located in third countries, to ensure that outsourcing is\nperformed in an orderly manner and not performed to an extent that would lead to the setting up\nof empty shells that no longer have the substance to remain authorised.\nThe guidelines aim to ensure that competent authorities are able to identify concentrations of\noutsourcing arrangements at service providers based on documentation provided by institutions\nand payment institutions, to identify and manage risks to the stability of the financial system.\nC. Baseline scenario\nOutsourcing requirements are currently specified in the CEBS guidelines on outsourcing. In\naddition, the EBA has published a recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers.\nOutsourcing by firms performing investment services is regulated under MiFID II and Commission\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565. Outsourcing by payment institutions is regulated under the\nPSD2.\nInstitutions should comply with the CRD. Article 74 CRD requires institutions to have robust\ngovernance arrangements, which include a clear organisational structure with well-defined,\ntransparent and consistent lines of responsibility, effective processes to identify, manage, monitor\nand report the risks they are or they might be exposed to and adequate internal control\nmechanisms. The EBA Guidelines on internal governance sufficiently specify the requirements,\nincluding the need for institutions to have appropriate outsourcing policies (see Section 8 of the\nguidelines); in addition, outsourcing needs to be approved as part of the institution’s new product\napproval and change processes (see Section 18 of the guidelines).\nArticle 76 CRD sets out requirements for the involvement of the management body in risk\nmanagement and Article 88 CRD sets out the responsibilities of the management body regarding\ngovernance arrangements; in both cases, the requirements are relevant for outsourced activities.\nAccording to Article 11 PSD2, competent authorities should grant an authorisation only if, taking\ninto account the need to ensure the sound and prudent management of a payment institution, the\npayment institution has robust governance arrangements for its payment services business, which\ninclude a clear organisational structure with well-defined, transparent and consistent lines of\nresponsibility, effective procedures to identify, manage, monitor and report the risks to which it is\nor might be exposed, and adequate internal control mechanisms, including sound administrative\nand accounting procedures; those arrangements, procedures and mechanisms must be\ncomprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the payment services\nprovided by the payment institution.\nInstitutions and payment institutions must ensure that sensitive data, including personal data, is\nadequately protected and kept confidential. Institutions must comply with the GDPR.\nAll of the above forms the baseline scenario of the impact assessment, which focuses only on the\nadditional costs and benefits created by the guidelines on outsourcing.\nD. Options considered\n1) Scope of application\nOption A: applying the guidelines only to credit institutions (as in the previous CEBS guidelines).\nOption B: applying the guidelines to all credit institutions and investment firms (both referred to as\n‘institutions’) that are subject to the CRD, payment institutions that are subject to the PSD2 and\nelectronic money institutions subject to the EMD (both referred to as ‘payment institutions’).\nFirms providing investment services are subject to the specific provisions on outsourcing included\nin MiFID II and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 of 25 April 2016 supplementing\nMiFID II.\nMiFID II and PSD2 already set out a framework for outsourcing. An application limited to credit\ninstitutions and their banking activities would be sufficient to complete the framework on\noutsourcing. However, such an approach (Option A) would potentially lead to inconsistencies\nbetween the different frameworks and to a situation in which there is not a level playing field\nbetween investment firms, payment institutions, electronic money institutions and credit\ninstitutions. In particular, credit institutions would need to implement separate arrangements for\nthe different types of activities.\nThe EBA’s scope of action covers not only credit institutions and investment firms subject to the\nCRD, but also payment and electronic money institutions. While the guidelines would cover all\nthose institutions and payment institutions, the guidelines would not directly be addressed to\naccount information service providers registered only for this service, credit intermediaries or non-\nbank creditors. Outsourcing arrangements between institutions and payment institutions and such\nentities are within the scope of the guidelines, as the requirements are addressed to institutions\nand payment institutions. Such an approach (Option B), if the requirements are aligned with the\nprovisions within MiFID II and the supplemental Commission Delegated Regulation and within the\nPSD2, would establish a level playing field between different types of financial institutions and\nensure that credit institutions can implement one framework for the outsourcing of their activities\ngoverned by different directives. The specific aspects of intragroup outsourcing and outsourcing\nwithin institutional protection schemes will be considered.\nOption B has been retained.\n2) Transitional arrangements\nOption A: setting an implementation period of the guidelines of one year, but without transitional\narrangements.\nOption B: setting the regular implementation period of six months and setting out transitional\narrangements to ensure that institutions can review contracts, update the assessment of the\ncriticality or importance of outsourcing and set up a register and update the documentation in line\nwith the requirements.\nOption B1: setting a fixed transitional period of around two years to review contracts, perform\nassessments and complete the register.\nOption B2: setting a period of around two years (other than for outsourcing arrangements to cloud\nservice providers, for which the EBA recommendation already applies), but requiring\ndocumentation and assessments to be updated if existing outsourcing arrangements are renewed\nduring that period. For critical or important arrangements, closer supervisory attention should be\napplied and, after the transitional period, their reassessment should be monitored.\nAll options would be effective to achieve the desired prudential outcome to have all outsourcing\narrangements documented in a way that differentiates between critical and important outsourcing,\nsets out a framework for such outsourcing and allows for the submission of a register to competent\nauthorities.\nOption A would delay the implementation of a common framework on outsourcing. Option A would\nlead to time pressure to re-assess the criticality or importance of outsourcing arrangements and\nupdate the register and this option might therefore increase the implementation costs. In addition,\nit might not be possible to renegotiate multiple outsourcing arrangements in a relatively short time\nperiod. Therefore, Option A has not been retained.\nOptions B1 and B2 would both ensure that institutions and payment institutions have sufficient\ntime to update their assessments and documentation. However, Option B1 would raise challenges,\nas contracts would need to be renegotiated within that time period, which may not always be\npossible.\nOption B2 would lead to a faster update than Option B1 for arrangements that are renewed during\nthe transitional period, but without additional burden, as an assessment of renewed outsourcing\narrangements would include the assessment of the related risks. Updating the documentation in\nthat context would be possible without causing material additional costs. Option B2 would have\nsome impact on the available time frame for the development of a database that could hold the\nregister. However, for this task, the regular implementation period should be sufficient. Additional\nscrutiny would be applied to critical or important outsourcing arrangements that are updated only\nafter the transitional period. While this would lead to additional costs for competent authorities for\nthe monitoring of the transition, it would reduce the costs of institutions, as the time pressure for\nrenegotiation of contracts or, in some cases, exit from arrangements (where there is no\nrenegotiation possible that ensures compliance with the guidelines) would be reduced.\nOption B2 has been retained, as it provides more flexibility but still ensures the effective supervision\nof outsourcing arrangements.\n3) Definition of outsourcing and the approach regarding the outsourcing of critical and important\nfunctions\nOption A: relying on the definition provided in MiFID II and the Commission Delegated Regulation\nand the approach to set more detailed requirements for the outsourcing of critical and important\nfunctions.\nOption B: the same as Option A, but also setting a lighter framework for other outsourcing\narrangements.\nOption C: creating a more narrow definition for the outsourcing of banking services.\nUsing a common definition (Option A) ensures that institutions can implement a single framework\nfor outsourcing regarding all of their activities and develop a good understanding of the scope of\noutsourcing. A focus on the outsourcing of critical or important functions should reduce the\nadministrative costs of applying the guidelines. However, the assessment of the criticality or\nimportance includes judgemental elements and therefore institutions, payment institutions and\ncompetent authorities may sometimes disagree regarding the assessment result. Retroactively\nintroducing safeguards for the outsourcing of critical or important functions, also in cases where\nthe assessment changes over time, could lead to additional costs and situations where necessary\ncontractual changes are difficult to agree on. In addition, the overall impact of outsourcing\narrangements that are themselves not critical or important might become relevant for the\nsupervision of an institution.\nUnder Option B, the impact described under Option A would apply; in addition, some requirements\nfor all outsourcing would be imposed, taking into account the principle of proportionality. This\nwould lead to only a minor additional administrative burden, as institutions would already need to\nhave in place some processes to manage all of their arrangements with third parties. In any case,\nalso for other outsourcing arrangements, institutions would already need to apply sound processes\nand would need to document the arrangements to ensure that they have robust governance\narrangements in place. Having guidelines in place that specify the regulatory minimum expectations\nfor such non-critical or non-important arrangements would provide a higher level of legal certainty.\nCosts for adjustments of internal processes should be minor. It would be ensured that the\noutsourcing process would be subject to a prescribed set of controls, which should mitigate the\nadditional measures that would need to be taken if an outsourcing arrangement became critical or\nimportant over time, e.g. because of the scalability of the arrangement.\nA narrower definition of outsourcing (Option C) for banking activities would limit the number of\noutsourcing arrangements and this would, at first sight, reduce the administrative costs of applying\nthe guidelines. However, the framework should ensure a sufficient focus on the outsourcing of\ncritical or important functions and, by doing so, this would limit the administrative burden. A\ndifferent definition would require different frameworks for different activities (e.g. banking versus\ninvestment services) and would lead to challenges in their application, as some arrangements affect\nbanking, but also investment and payment services (e.g. underlying IT infrastructures). Therefore,\nOption C is not effective.\nOption B has been retained.\n4) Specification of the basic requirements on governance arrangements, outsourcing policy,\nconflicts of interest, business continuity and internal audit function that are, in principle, covered\nalready in the EBA Guidelines on internal governance\nOption A: the guidelines should not specify such requirements, as the EBA Guidelines on internal\ngovernance are sufficient.\nOption B: the guidelines should specify the additional aspects that are specific in terms of\noutsourcing.\nThe guidelines on internal governance do not apply to payment institutions; therefore, Option A\nwould be less effective than Option B, even if one were to take into account the fact that the\nprudential risks within such institutions would be low compared with institutions that are subject\nto the CRD. This option would also not provide legal certainty in the same way as Option B.\nThe inclusion of the aspects listed (Option B) provides certainty regarding the supervisory\nexpectations and ensures that there are safeguards within institutions not covered by the CRD; this\noption also provides legal certainty and clarity regarding supervisory expectations for institutions\nsubject to the CRD. This is desirable to achieve harmonisation, but also because of consumer\nprotection aspects (e.g. the continuous functioning of payment services should be ensured).\nOption B has been retained.\n5) Documentation requirements and the submission of documentation to competent authorities\nDocumentation should be comprehensive, provide an appropriate overview on outsourcing\narrangements (including the main risks identified regarding the outsourcing of critical and\nimportant functions) and allow for the identification of concentration risks on a micro level by\ninstitutions and payment institutions and on both a micro and a macro level by competent\nauthorities.\nOption A: requiring institutions and payment institutions to document all outsourcing\narrangements, but without specifying further requirements.\nOption B: requiring institutions and payment institutions to document all outsourcing\narrangements and to maintain a register for all existing outsourcing arrangements.\nOption B1: limiting the register to only the outsourcing of critical and important functions.\nOption B2: having all outsourcing arrangements documented in the register, but with the extent of\ndocumentation that is required differing between critical or important functions and other\noutsourcing.\nOption C: the same as Option B, but requiring that planned outsourcing arrangements also have to\nbe documented in the register as soon as their implementation is likely.\nOption D: in addition to requiring a register, requiring institutions and payment institutions to liaise\nwith competent authorities regarding all new outsourcing arrangements of critical and important\nfunctions, but leaving the details to the competent authorities.\nOption E: the same as Option D, but requiring prior approval or a non-objection procedure\nimplemented by the competent authority.\nOption A would not necessarily result in a comprehensive register that would be readily available\nfor submission to the competent authority and would allow neither institutions nor their\ncompetent authorities to efficiently identify risk concentrations. A requirement to have a register\nof all cloud outsourcing arrangements already exists. Option A therefore has not been retained.\nOption B would ensure that institutions, payment institutions and competent authorities have an\noverview of all relevant outsourcing arrangements and would be in a position to assess risk\nconcentrations. By defining a minimum set of aspects to be documented, this option would ensure\nthat there is sufficient information available to assess the risk posed by outsourcing, e.g. within the\nSREP. The information should be limited to reduce the burden. Additional information could always\nbe requested by competent authorities.\nOption B1 would lead to slightly lower costs, as not all outsourcing arrangements would need to be\nincluded in the register. However, documentation would be necessary in any case. By including at\nleast a limited set of information (Option B2) for all other outsourcing arrangements, the\nidentification of concentration risks would be even better than in Option B1. As a register would\nalready exist, the costs would be low, as the costs would be limited to those involved in the input\nof a few additional data points into the register. Option B2 would be more efficient than Option B1.\nAdding planned outsourcing to the register (Option C) would give competent authorities the\npossibility to evaluate the potential effect of upcoming outsourcing arrangements combined with\nother existing outsourcing arrangements. However, it would also lead to a situation where\ninstitutions and payment institutions would enter potential arrangements that would not come\ninto effect, leading to minor additional costs for adding such arrangements to the register.\nHowever, if arrangements were entered into the register only if they were nearly certain, they\nwould be entered relatively quickly and therefore this process might not ensure that competent\nauthorities were informed in a timely manner about upcoming outsourcing arrangements.\nOption D would ensure that competent authorities would be informed about upcoming outsourcing\narrangements and would have the opportunity to intervene if they had concerns about potential\nrisks or if such an arrangement would lead to a situation where the institution would become an\nempty shall that lacked the substance for ongoing authorisation. The impact on costs for\ninstitutions and payment institutions would be low, but if feedback from the competent authority\n(Option E) was expected, this might delay the implementation of arrangements and could therefore\nlead to additional costs. In most jurisdictions, such processes (Option D) already exist and therefore\nthe costs would be limited to jurisdictions where no prior discussion had taken place. A dialogue\nbetween institutions and competent authorities regarding outsourcing improves the effective\nsupervision of firms.\nOptions B2 and D have been retained.\n6) Guidelines on the assessment of risks and the criticality or importance of outsourced functions\nand their continued monitoring\nOption A: the guidelines would leave it up to institutions and payment institutions to develop their\nown assessment framework.\nOption B: the guidelines would specify, in line with MiFID II and PSD2 requirements, the approach\nfor assessing the criticality or importance of functions.\nOption C: the guidelines would specify a framework for the ongoing monitoring of outsourcing\narrangements.\nOption A would not be effective, as it would not lead to the desired level of harmonisation of the\nassessment results.\nOption B would ensure that there would be one harmonised framework that takes into account the\nassessment criteria provided in MiFID II and PSD2, but would provide additional criteria for the\nassessment of the impact of outsourcing arrangements. Assessing the operational risk impact is\none aspect that is relevant for determining if an outsourced function is critical or important. Such\nrisks include the so-called step-in risk that may be triggered if the service provider were in financial\ndistress and needed financial support by the institution or payment institution to maintain the\nservices provided; this is particularly relevant for significant institutions. A harmonised set of\ncriteria to be implemented by institutions and payment institutions would not create greater costs\nthan if institutions defined their own framework. However, where there is already a framework in\nplace that is in line with the MiFID II and PSD2 requirements, institutions would have one-off costs\nfor adjusting that framework.\nOption C would ensure that changes to the criticality or importance of outsourcing arrangements\nwould be identified by all institutions and payment institutions. Under Option C, the guidelines\nwould provide a more specific framework for monitoring outsourcing risks than the EBA Guidelines\non internal governance, which are applicable to institutions subject to the CRD only. Option C would\nbe effective. Additional costs would be limited to adjustments to the already existing risk\nmanagement framework.\nOptions B and C have been retained.\n7) Outsourcing of banking activities and payment services that require authorisation by a\ncompetent authority\nAlthough most outsourcing arrangements involve activities or services (or parts thereof) that do\nnot, in themselves, require authorisation by a competent authority, institutions may occasionally\nwant to outsource functions or parts of banking or payment services or activities, to an extent that\nwould require authorisation or registration in their Member State, to service providers located in\nthird countries. The outsourcing of investment services is regulated under Commission Delegated\nRegulation (EU) 2017/565 of 25 April 2016.\nThe outsourced parts of banking activities or payment services may themselves require\nauthorisation. However, the full service or activity, i.e. including the responsibility for the service or\nactivity, can never be outsourced. While, within the EU, a common framework for authorisation\nand supervision applies, outsourcing to third countries would, in most cases, not be subject to the\nsame framework. Therefore, this specific type of outsourcing arrangement should be allowed only\nif:\n the service provider in the third country is authorised by or registered at a relevant\nsupervisory authority to perform the activity or service; and\n the outsourcing arrangement will not undermine the ability of the competent authority in\nthe Member State to effectively supervise the outsourcing institution or payment\ninstitution. This will commonly require that the competent authority is able to receive the\ninformation needed for its supervisory tasks and exercise access and audit rights in the\nthird country and that there exist mechanisms for the exchange of information on\nenforcement matters.\nTwo policy options have been considered.\nOption A would allow the outsourcing of banking and payment activities or services, which are\nsubject to authorisation or registration, to third countries only if there is an appropriate\ncooperation agreement between the competent authority of the institution and the supervisory\nauthority of the service provider.\nOption B would be an outcomes-focused approach and would require institutions and payment\ninstitutions to be satisfied that any proposed outsourcing of functions (or parts of banking or\npayment services or activities) that require direct authorisation to service providers located in third\ncountries would not prevent or undermine the ability of competent authorities in their Member\nState to effectively supervise them. Competent authorities would have the power to take measures\nif effective supervision were not possible.\nOption A would be in line with the approach for investment services under Article 32 of the\nCommissions Delegated Regulation, which requires such a cooperation agreement in the case of\noutsourcing functions of portfolio management; it ensures that the rights and responsibilities of\nthe competent authority and the supervisory authority would be set out in writing.\nHowever, such an approach would also require competent authorities to enter into multiple,\nlengthy negotiations with third countries to conclude the required cooperation agreements, even\nif institutions and payment institutions would need to be satisfied that there is a cooperation\nagreement between the competent authority of the institution or payment institution and the\ncompetent authority in the third country responsible for supervising such services or activities\nwhere they outsource those banking and payment activities or services. If a cooperation agreement\ndoes not exist, then outsourcing of banking and payment activities or services into the third country\nis not possible.\nOption B recognises that effective supervision could be achieved through a variety of arrangements\nand mechanisms, including, but not necessarily limited to, cooperation agreements or supervisory\ncolleges. Although more flexible and pragmatic, Option B would require competent authorities to\ndetermine that they can effectively discharge their supervisory duties in practice. In particular,\ncompetent authorities need to be satisfied that they will not be faced with restrictions regarding\nthe exercise of information, access and audit rights. This is clearly more difficult without signing a\ncooperation agreement. Competent authorities would also need to reserve the right to require\ninstitutions and payment institutions to not enter into or terminate existing outsourcing\nagreements if the outsourcing concerned an activity or service that was itself subject to\nauthorisation, if the competent authorities were not satisfied that they would be able to effectively\nsupervise it. This approach would lead to legal uncertainty about the possibility of outsourcing\nfunctions to service providers in third countries.\nOption A has been retained.\n8) Setting minimum requirements for outsourcing contracts\nTo ensure that documentation requirements can be met, institutions and payment institutions\nneed to have written arrangements in place that at least reflect the documentation requirements.\nOption A: the guidelines would not set out additional contractual provisions above the\naforementioned aspects.\nOption B: the guidelines would define the minimum content of outsourcing arrangements,\ndifferentiating between critical or important outsourcing and other outsourcing. In particular, the\nguidelines would deal with the aspect of audit and access rights.\nOption A would be in line with the principle of contractual freedom and the principle that the\ninstitution or payment institution is responsible for its outsourcing arrangements. Requirements\nspecified in MiFID II and PSD2 would have to be met. However, such a guideline would not provide\nsufficient clarity regarding audit and access rights and other aspects that facilitate the appropriate\nmanagement of outsourcing arrangements (e.g. termination and exit rights).\nOption B would help institutions and payment institutions to agree on contracts that meet the\nminimum requirements expected by competent authorities, in particular with regard to the\noutsourcing of critical or important functions. The approach to audit, one aspect that is particularly\ndifficult to negotiate, would be described in detail, leading to a higher level of efficiency at\ninstitutions and payment institutions when negotiating contracts. Such requirements are already\nincluded in the recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers and information and\naccess rights are outlined in Article 65 CRD. The implementation of these requirements for other\nnew outsourcing arrangements should not lead to additional material costs, in particular if the\nscope of such a requirement is restricted to a subset of outsourcing arrangements; instead it would\nensure that outsourced activities can be monitored, audited and supervised.\nOption B has been retained.\n9) Guidelines for competent authorities\nCompetent authorities already supervise outsourcing arrangements under the SREP guidelines for\ninstitutions and as part of other supervisory processes for payment institutions.\nOption A: the guidelines should provide a detailed procedural framework for supervision by\ncompetent authorities, including the timing of procedures and the need to assess new critical and\nimportant outsourcing arrangements before they are implemented.\nOption B: the guidelines should ensure that competent authorities are appropriately informed of\noutsourcing arrangements, but would leave the setting of detailed supervisory procedures to the\ncompetent authority.\nAn assessment of outsourcing arrangements by competent authorities before their implementation\n(Option A) might lead to additional costs at institutions and payment institutions, as the\nimplementation of processes could be delayed. Competent authorities would need to have\nadditional staff resources to ensure a timely assessment.\nOption B is sufficient, as the SREP is already harmonised within the EBA guidelines. For payment\ninstitutions, competent authorities are already informed about the outsourcing of payment\nservices. However, given the periodicity of the SREP, additional information on new critical or\nimportant outsourcing arrangements, while carrying low additional costs, ensures that competent\nauthorities can effectively supervise institutions and the concentration of outsourcing at service\nproviders.\nOption B has been retained.\nE. Cost-benefit analysis\nThe guidelines impose a limited set of specific requirements on institutions, payment institutions\nand competent authorities under the already existing framework, providing clarification and\nprocedural guidance.\nA higher level of clarity on outsourcing requirements benefits institutions by creating a higher level\nof transparency regarding regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. Standardised\nrequirements lead to a reduction in costs for implementing processes, in particular when assessed\non a consolidated basis.\nHarmonisation should increase the efficiency of supervision. In particular, the identification and\nsupervision of concentration risks by competent authorities may have a positive effect on the\nstability of the financial markets. However, this means that competent authorities will have to\nassign more resources to the supervision of such risk concentrations and/or may have one-off IT\ncosts for establishing databases and inputting data to better track such concentrations. Those costs\nshould be limited, as, on a risk-based approach, such measures should be limited to critical or\nimportant outsourcing.\nThe guidelines aim to ensure that institutions and payment institutions cannot become empty\nshells; this additional assurance protects the level playing field within the EU/EEA.\nHowever, the guidelines will trigger some implementation costs for institutions (credit institutions\nand investment firms) and payment institutions, which will differ depending on their nature:\na. For payment institutions and investment firms subject to the CRD, considering that the\nsectoral directives already establish a set of requirements for outsourcing that is quite\ndetailed, the additional costs should be very low.\nb. For credit institutions subject to the CRD, a detailed framework exists regarding their\ninvestment and payment services and activities. Regarding banking activities, the previous\nCEBS guidelines form the basis of the EBA guidelines and therefore the additional costs\ntriggered by the guidelines should be low overall.\nFor institutions and payment institutions, the guidelines may require an update of the current\ninternal documentation, as well as the implementation and maintenance of a formal register in the\nform of a database. Some minor one-off costs may be triggered by the need to update outsourcing\npolicies and to establish the register of all outsourcing arrangements (e.g. in terms of the additional\ndata input on top of existing internal documentation). The overall impact is considered low, as\ninstitutions and payment institutions must already have documentation in place regarding their\norganisational structure, which includes outsourcing arrangements. Moreover, a formal register\nwith minimum requirements will also be beneficial to the management of outsourcing\narrangements and will improve the identification of risk concentrations on a micro and macro level.\nThe assessment of the criticality or importance of outsourcing arrangements by institutions subject\nto the CRD is also a requirement to consider. The criteria are consistent with other legislation in\nplace; therefore, the additional costs are considered to be low. In addition, the guidelines provide\nclarity and harmonised criteria that need to be implemented by all institutions and payment\ninstitutions (i.e. not only by institutions subject to the CRD). The clear difference in the\nrequirements for outsourcing critical or important functions and for other outsourcing\narrangements benefit institutions and payment institutions in terms of the allocation of internal\nresources. The guidelines provide clear criteria to identify a function as critical or important,\nincluding where a defect or failure materially impairs the activities and financial performance. This\nis more evident for core business lines and critical functions already defined by the other legislation\nin place. Most institutions and payment institutions should have such processes in place regarding\ntheir investment and payment services and activities and, therefore, the roll out to banking\nactivities should not be complex. The additional clarity, the protection of the level playing field and\nthe proportionality of requirements all benefit the institutions and payment institutions. Therefore,\nthe additional costs should be very low and should mainly be one-off costs for implementing the\nprocedures needed. Given the existing procedures and the consistency with the other legislation\nthat is already in place, the cost for applying new, more harmonised, procedures in the area of\nbanking activities should be low. The risk assessment of outsourcing arrangements needs to include\na more thorough assessment of the operational risks. The assessment of whether a function or part\nthereof is outsourced on a recurrent basis is a task already conducted on an ongoing basis. The\nidentification of concentration risks caused by the outsourcing of multiple functions to one service\nprovider may create additional, although low, costs, but only if this is not already part of the regular\nassessment of operational risk and concentration risk.\nThe guidelines provide clarification on the treatment of the outsourcing of functions by institutions\nand payment institutions when considered at the group level and when taking into account the\npossible interlinkages between operational risks. All institutions and payment institutions should\nalready be familiar with risk assessments; all should already conduct scenario analyses at the\nindividual and group levels and perform such risk assessments in line with other legislation and\nother EU guidelines, as they are obliged to manage all of their risks. Therefore, there are low\nadditional costs for institutions and payment institutions.\nClear contractual requirements, including requirements to assure access and audit rights, lead to\nminor one-off costs and reduce the ongoing costs for negotiating outsourcing arrangements with\nservice providers, as they establish a non-debateable set of contractual conditions to be agreed on.\nThe clarification of supervisory expectations regarding outsourcing arrangements benefits\ninstitutions and payment institutions during the negotiations of contractual conditions and\npractical deliveries and creates a level playing field.\nThe specification of how audits can be performed regarding outsourcing is based on legislation and\nrecommendations that are already in place and therefore does not trigger any additional costs;\nhowever, it does provide clarity about the supervisory expectations.\n5.2 Feedback on the public consultation"
