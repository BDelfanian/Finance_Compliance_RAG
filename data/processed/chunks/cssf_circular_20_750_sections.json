User accountability: financial institutions should limit, as much as possible, the use of\ngeneric and shared user accounts and ensure that users can be identified for the actions\nperformed in the ICT systems.\nc. Privileged access rights: financial institutions should implement strong controls over\nprivileged system access by strictly limiting and closely supervising accounts with\nelevated system access entitlements (e.g. administrator accounts).

Access management: access rights should be granted, withdrawn or modified in a\ntimely manner, according to predefined approval workflows that involve the business\nowner of the information being accessed (information asset owner). In the case of\ntermination of employment, access rights should be promptly withdrawn.\nf. Access recertification: access rights should be periodically reviewed to ensure that\nusers do not possess excessive privileges and that access rights are withdrawn when no\nlonger required.\ng. Authentication methods: financial institutions should enforce authentication methods\nthat are sufficiently robust to adequately and effectively ensure that access control\npolicies and procedures are complied with. Authentication methods should be\ncommensurate with the criticality of ICT systems, information or the process being\naccessed.

Financial institutions should implement measures to protect the integrity of the source codes of\nICT systems that are developed in-house. They should also document the development,\nimplementation, operation and/or configuration of the ICT systems comprehensively to reduce\nany unnecessary dependency on subject matter experts. The documentation of the ICT system\nshould contain, where applicable, at least user documentation, technical system documentation\nand operating procedures.\n74. A financial institution’s processes for acquisition and development of ICT systems should also\napply to ICT systems developed or managed by the business function’s end users outside the\nICT organisation (e.g. end user computing applications) using a risk-based approach. The\nfinancial institution should maintain a register of these applications that support critical business\nfunctions or processes."

Financial institutions should establish and implement an ICT change management process to\nensure that all changes to ICT systems are recorded, tested, assessed, approved, implemented\nand verified in a controlled manner. Financial institutions should handle the changes during\nemergencies (i.e. changes that must be introduced as soon as possible) following procedures\nthat provide adequate safeguards.\n76.

These changes should be in accordance with the financial institutions’\nformal change management process.\n\n77.

As part of sound business continuity management, financial institutions should conduct business\nimpact analysis (BIA) by analysing their exposure to severe business disruptions and assessing\ntheir potential impacts (including on confidentiality, integrity and availability), quantitatively and\nqualitatively, using internal and/or external data (e.g. third-party provider data relevant to a\nbusiness process or publicly available data that may be relevant to the BIA) and scenario\nanalysis. The BIA should also consider the criticality of the identified and classified business\nfunctions, supporting processes, third parties and information assets, and their\ninterdependencies, in accordance with Section 3.3.3.\n79. Financial institutions should ensure that their ICT systems and ICT services are designed and\naligned with their BIA, for example with redundancy of certain critical components to prevent\ndisruptions caused by events impacting those components."

Based on their BIAs, financial institutions should establish plans to ensure business continuity\n(business continuity plans, BCPs), which should be documented and approved by their\nmanagement bodies. The plans should specifically consider risks that could adversely impact ICT\nsystems and ICT services. The plans should support objectives to protect and, if necessary, re-\nestablish the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their business functions, supporting\nprocesses and information assets. Financial institutions should coordinate with relevant internal\nand external stakeholders, as appropriate, during the establishment of these plans.\n81. Financial institutions should put BCPs in place to ensure that they can react appropriately to\npotential failure scenarios and that they are able to recover the operations of their critical\nbusiness activities after disruptions within a recovery time objective (RTO, the maximum time\nwithin which a system or process must be restored after an incident) and a recovery point\nobjective (RPO, the maximum time period during which it is acceptable for data to be lost in the\nevent of an incident). In cases of severe business disruption that trigger specific business\ncontinuity plans, financial institutions should prioritise business continuity actions using risk-\nbased approach, which can be based on the risk assessments carried out under Section 3.3.3.\nFor PSPs this may include, for example, facilitating the further processing of critical transactions\nwhile remediation efforts continue.\n82. A financial institution should consider a range of different scenarios in its BCP, including extreme\nbut plausible ones to which it might be exposed, including a cyber-attack scenario, and it should\nassess the potential impact that such scenarios might have. Based on these scenarios, a financial\ninstitution should describe how the continuity of ICT systems and services, as well as the\nfinancial institution’s information security, are ensured."

The response and recovery plans should consider both short-term and long-term recovery\noptions. The plans should:\na. focus on the recovery of the operations of critical business functions, supporting\nprocesses, information assets and their interdependencies to avoid adverse effects on\nthe functioning of financial institutions and on the financial system, including on payment\nsystems and on payment service users, and to ensure execution of pending payment\ntransactions;\nb. be documented and made available to the business and support units and readily\naccessible in the event of an emergency;\nc. be updated in line with lessons learned from incidents, tests, new risks identified and\nthreats, and changed recovery objectives and priorities.\n85.

Furthermore, as part of the response and recovery plans, a financial institution should consider\nand implement continuity measures to mitigate failures of third-party providers, which are of\nkey importance for a financial institution’s ICT service continuity (in line with the provisions of\nthe Circular CSSF 22/806 on outsourcing arrangements regarding business continuity plans)."

In particular they should:\na. include testing of an adequate set of severe but plausible scenarios including those\nconsidered for the development of the BCPs (as well as testing of services provided by\nthird parties, where applicable); this should include the switch-over of critical business\nfunctions, supporting processes and information assets to the disaster recovery\nenvironment and demonstrating that they can be run in this way for a sufficiently\nrepresentative period of time and that normal functioning can be restored afterwards;\nb. be designed to challenge the assumptions on which BCPs rest, including governance\narrangements and crisis communication plans; and\nc. include procedures to verify the ability of their staff and contractors, ICT systems and\nICT services to respond adequately to the scenarios defined in paragraph 89(a).\n90.
