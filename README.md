# AI-Enabled Compliance Risk Assessment (Prototype)

This project explores how retrieval-grounded AI systems can support compliance risk assessment over unstructured financial regulatory documents, with explicit focus on explainability and human oversight.

Status: Initial data ingestion phase.

## Project Scope
Goal (MVP):  
Build a RAG-based system that answers regulatory compliance questions using CSSF + EU regulatory documents, with retrieval grounding and traceable outputs.

## Setup

This project uses Python and a virtual environment for reproducibility.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
